great stepsforward, when a combination of the right tools, a capacity for innovation, and sparks of ingenuity lead tobreakthroughs that transform how we live our lives.', 'How we produce and process information is critical to innovation – and our methods of recording andcommunicating information', 'have themselves undergone great leaps.', 'From the development of writing, toGutenberg’s printing press – which advanced the spread of knowledge to the masses and ushered in theenlightenment and scientific revolution – to the first programmable digital computer Colossus, the cost ofreproducing and communicating information, or data, has fallen again and again.', 'At the same time, toolsfor processing and making sense of large quantities of data have developed exponentially – with artificialintelligence (AI) representing the latest leap.', 'In the same way that Gutenberg’s press ushered in a newera of growth, data-driven technologies such as AI will underpin our future prosperity.', 'There is no doubt that machine learning and AI is already improving peoples’ lives, from intelligentpersonal assistants that can prepare us for changes in the weather, to systems that protect our moneyfrom criminals, or devices that offer medical advice from the comfort of our own home.', 'And this is onlythe start; the potential of AI is undeniable.', 'Our next challenge will be to harness this technology totransform how we diagnose diseases, manufacture goods and build our homes.', 'Using advanced algorithmic techniques such as ‘deep learning’, AI has the potential to solve complexproblems fast, and in so doing, free up time and raise productivity.', 'But we also need to make sure AIbenefits everyone in the UK, which is why – in addition to this Sector Deal – the

great stepsforward, when a combination of the right tools, a capacity for innovation, and sparks of ingenuity lead tobreakthroughs that transform how we live our lives.', 'How we produce and process information is critical to innovation – and our methods of recording andcommunicating information have themselves undergone great leaps.', 'From the development of writing, toGutenberg’s printing press – which advanced the spread of knowledge to the masses and ushered in theenlightenment and scientific revolution – to the first programmable digital computer Colossus, the cost ofreproducing and communicating information, or data, has fallen again and again.', 'At the same time, toolsfor processing and making sense of large quantities of data have developed exponentially – with artificialintelligence (AI) representing the latest leap.', 'In the same way that Gutenberg’s press ushered in a newera of growth, data-driven technologies such as AI will underpin our future prosperity.', 'There is no doubt that machine learning and AI is already improving peoples’ lives, from intelligentpersonal assistants that can prepare us for changes in the weather, to systems that protect our moneyfrom criminals, or devices that offer medical advice from the comfort of our own home.', 'And this is onlythe start; the potential of AI is undeniable.', 'Our next challenge will be to harness this technology totransform how we diagnose diseases, manufacture goods and build our homes.', 'Using advanced algorithmic techniques such as ‘deep learning’, AI has the potential to solve complexproblems fast, and in so doing, free up time and raise productivity.', 'But we also need to make sure AIbenefits everyone in the UK, which is why – in addition to this Sector Deal – the government isestablishing a Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation to advise on the ethical use of data, including for AI.The huge global opportunity AI presents is why the Industrial Strategy white paper(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-building-a-britain-fit-for-the-future) identified AI anddata as 1 of 4 Grand Challenges – in which the UK can lead the world for years to come.', 'The UK is well placed to do this.', 'We are already home to some of the biggest names in the businesssuch as Deepmind, Swiftkey and Babylon.', 'And it’s not just the established players – Kwiziq, Cleo and Mindtrace are examples of UK AI startupsleading the way in areas as diverse as education, personal finance and autonomous vehicles.', 'Majorestablished companies in the tech sector, but also increasingly beyond, are using AI to tune up theiroperations and services.', 'To realise all the social and economic benefits, we will need a strong partnership between business,academia and government.', 'This sector deal establishes the beginning of that partnership.', 'It responds tothe recommendations of the AI Review, ‘Growing the AI Industry in the UK’(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/growing-the-artificial-intelligence-industry-in-the-uk), led by ProfessorDame Wendy Hall and Jérôme Pesenti, which articulated how the government and industry can worktogether on skills, infrastructure and implement a longterm strategy for AI in the UK.We need to be strategic and focused: recognising the increasing convergence of technologies andfocusing on the areas where we can compete globally.', 'While robotics, a complementary technology to AI, was outside the scope of the AI Review,recommendations on the robotics industry have been made in the Robotics Review RAS 2020(https://connect.innovateuk.org/documents/2903012/16074728/RAS%20UK%20Strategy?version=1.0), and in‘Made Smarter’

review, published in October 2017, engaged widely withbusinesses, academia, investors and other stakeholders on ways to boost the UK’s emerging AI sector athome and across the world.', 'It sets out proposals to improve the institutions that support AI in the UnitedKingdom, to build a skilled workforce, and to stimulate access to data – collectively the lifeblood of any AIbusiness.', 'This Sector Deal reinforces the 5 foundations of the Industrial Strategy:ideaspeopleinfrastructurebusiness environmentplacesIt also draws on the government’s Digital Strategy (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-strategy), which focuses on reinforcing our strengths in telecoms, data and enterprise.', 'A key ambition ofthe industrial strategy is for the UK to be the world’s most innovative economy – this Sector Deal aims toattract and retain both domestic and global AI talent; deliver major upgrades to our digital and datainfrastructure; ensure that the UK is the best place to start and grow an AI business; and contribute tocommunities’ prosperity by spreading the benefits of AI across the country.', 'PeopleThe Industrial Strategy has people at its core: it is focused on creating good jobs and greater earningpower for all people in the UK.', 'To do this, we must equip citizens for jobs shaped by next generationtechnology.', 'Growing the AI industry in the UK outlined the fast-growing demand for expertise to developand apply AI technologies, and proposed ways to increase the supply of skills at different levels.', 'Buildingon these recommendations and the commitments in the Industrial Strategy and Digital Strategy to growscience, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) and digital skills training, this Sector Deal sets outhow the government, universities and industry will work together to greatly improve the supply of skills.', 'Italso sets out how we will attract the best, and most diverse, global AI talent to the UK.InfrastructureEnsuring the UK has the right digital infrastructure – both physical and, crucially, data infrastructure – iscritical to meeting our ambition of leading the world in AI.', 'That is why, as part of our Industrial Strategy,we are investing over £1 billion to create a country with world class digital capabilities: from 5G mobilenetworks to full-fibre broadband.', 'Equally important is the availability of data, which is required on a vastscale to train machine learning systems.', 'The government and public bodies are already leading the wayin making public datasets open and available.', 'But there remain significant challenges to sharing privatesector datasets.', 'Through this Sector Deal, we will tackle both the practical and cultural barriers to sharingboth publicly and privately held data.', 'As part of this we will explore data sharing frameworks such asData Trusts – mechanisms where parties have defined rights and responsibilities with respect to shareddata – in order to protect sensitive data, facilitate access to data, and ensure accountability.', 'This willallow and ensure fair and equitable data sharing between organisations in the private sector, andbetween the private and public sectors.', 'IdeasThe government set out a vision in the Industrial Strategy to make the UK the world’s most innovativeeconomy.', 'To achieve this, we are committing to work with the private sector to boost research anddevelopment (R&D) spending to 2.4% by 2027, and 3% over the longer term.', 'This begins with a £725million investment through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund competition, designed to capture thevalue of innovation by commercialising a great idea in the lab to a successful business.', 'For example, oneearly commitment is our £210 million Challenge on research into the early diagnosis of chronic illness –including a substantial investment in AI diagnostics techniques2.', 'The use of AI is central to this work,which includes programmes applying AI to raise output in sectors of the economy that have struggledwith productivity, from reducing crop disease in the agriculture sector, to delivering services digitally in thepublic sector.', 'We are seeing industry respond to our commitment to AI innovation with investments inR&D in the UK, such as those from major players like Beyond Limits and Element AI.Business EnvironmentOur intention is to be the best place to start and grow a business in the world.', 'With a new businessstarting up every 75 seconds in the UK, and a massive increase in the finance available to knowledge-intensive and innovative firms – such as those developing AI – through the British Business Bank, we arein a strong starting position.', 'As at September 2017, over £350 million3 has been invested in 243 technology companies through theBritish Business Bank’s venture capital programmes.', 'AI is emerging in its own right as a nascent industry with the potential to raise the productivity of diversesectors and create entirely new jobs.', 'To maximise this potential, this deal will establish a new AI Councilto bring together respected leaders in the field from across academia and industry; a new delivery bodywithin the government – the Office for Artificial Intelligence – to support it; and a new Centre for DataEthics and Innovation.', 'The deal will also increase promotion of AI businesses globally and take steps toattract AI entrepreneurs to the UK.', 'A recent report by Oxford Insights ranked the UK top for governmentreadiness to implement AI, and these measures will allow us to capitalise on the UK’s worldclass R&Dand tech entrepreneur base4.PlacesThe Industrial Strategy set out the goal of helping communities prosper throughout the UK.', 'Growing theAI industry in the UK outlined the thriving AI ecosystem that already exists.', 'London is the Europeancapital of AI, while significant clusters exist in places such as Edinburgh, Belfast, Bristol and Cambridge.', 'As important as the growth of these clusters of expertise is, our ambition is for AI to be adopted bybusinesses across the country.', 'This deal will help businesses around the UK to grow using AI, and issupported by the government’s backing for the expansion of Tech City UK (https://www.techcityuk.com/) andTech North (https://technorthhq.com/) into the national network

compound annual growth rate of over60% to 20227.', 'We must take concerted action or risk other countries seizing the opportunity and causinga brain drain from the UK.In 2017 there were 26 UK universities offering undergraduate courses in AI and more than 30 graduateprogrammes running across 20 universities.', 'Numbers of students have been rising modestly in recentyears, driven predominantly by PhD level places (where the number of enrolments have almost doubledto just under 400 between 2013 and 20158).', 'A recent government consultation with AI academicshighlighted the gap between supply and demand for university places, with one institution turning down13 viable candidates per available masters place.', 'The government recognises that to provide the advanced skills needed for creating AI algorithms, thework begins in schools.', 'That is why we have announced a major reform of technical education with thelaunch of T levels and investment in STEM subjects.', 'We announced in the 2017 Autumn Budget £84million of new funding to deliver a comprehensive 4 year programme to improve computing educationand drive up participation in computer science, including

everyday from maps on our smartphones, to social media and payment processes.', 'Withoutaccess to good quality data from a range of sources (whether privately or publicly held), AI technologiescannot deliver on their promise of better, more efficient and seamless services.', 'Open data published by organisations across a range of sectors have enabled other businesses toinnovate and build new services, which in turn can make significant contributions to the economy.', 'Transport apps such as CityMapper, for example, make journeys more efficient and have led to thecreation of ‘pop-up’ bus routes for commonly made journeys that were previously unserved.', 'Similarly, open environmental data has been used to create flood risk and water quality apps.', 'To test theautonomous vehicles of the future we will need good quality 3D topographic data on road conditions androadside obstacles.', 'The government is committed to opening up more data in a way that makes it reusable and easilyaccessible.', 'A good example is geospatial data.', 'The Geospatial Commission announced in the 2017Autumn Budget will provide strategic oversight to the various public bodies who hold geospatial data,seeking to maximise the growth of the digital economy and consolidate the UK’s position as the bestplace to start and grow a digital business.', 'To further boost the digital economy,

cloudbased machine learning model, whichwas trained on a database of 3 million emails previously classified by call centre agents.', 'Machine learning is also used to monitor the health of their robot swarms, which carry out the bulk ofthe work in their new automated warehouses.', 'Here, data from the robots are streamed to a datalake where analytical systems oversee performance and identify servicing requirements.', 'Byprogramming machine learning into the robots themselves using technologies such as embeddedTensor Flow, this also creates opportunities for swarm learning, where the learnings of one robot canbe shared with the rest of the swarm, a concept which will keep driverless vehicles responsive andagile when on the road.', 'These are just 2 examples of the many ways that AI and machine learning pervade Ocado’s end-to-end e-commerce, fulfilment and logistics platform.', 'Develop fair, equitable and secure data sharing frameworksSome of the most valuable data – in terms of its potential for enabling innovation, improving services ofrealising public sector savings – cannot be made open because it contains nationally critical, personal orcommercially sensitive information.', 'This includes data which could be used to identify individuals.', 'Organisations looking to access or share data can often face a range of barriers, from trust and culturalconcerns to practical and legal obstacles.', 'To address these issues, we are working with industry topioneer mechanisms for data sharing such as Data Trusts.', 'These frameworks will ensure that all partiesinvolved have defined rights and responsibilities towards the data and individuals’ personal data, andother sensitive data, is protected.', 'For example, the vision for Data Trusts is that they will allow 2 or moreparties in any sector to partner in data sharing agreements, shape the agreements according to theirneeds and enable multiple organisations to work together to solve a common
