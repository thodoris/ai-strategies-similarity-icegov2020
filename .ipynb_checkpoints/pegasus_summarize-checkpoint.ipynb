    "This document presents the Hellenic National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (AI), as developed by a multidisciplinary team of Greek Scientists and AI Experts under the auspices and supervision of the Ministry of Digital Governance.  \n",
    "The strategy is aligned to the EU policies and recommendations for AI, as well as to relevant initiatives (e.g., the EU HLEG expert group, Council of Europe on AI (CAHAI), AI4EU, AI4People). Moreover, its development has considered international best practices from the strategies of other EU-27 countries and the UK, as well as from other prominent AI strategies outside the EU. However, the development of the AI Strategy is primarily driven by the socio-economic priorities of the country, including:\n",
    " Economic Growth: Following more than ten years of economic recession and staggering growth during 2008-2019, Greece is set to face the dramatic economic implications of the COVID19 pandemic. Investments in research and innovation such as AI provide first-class opportunities for restarting the Greek economy and increasing its competitiveness in effective and sustainable ways. In this direction, the strategy includes many activities that can boost the economic growth of Greek enterprises, including large industries, SME (Small Medium Enterprises) and high-tech Centres. \n",
    " Digital Transformation: Despite the low ranking of the country in the DESI (Digital Economy and Society Index) standings, Greece has a positive digital transformation momentum. During the past two years, the rebranded Ministry of Digital Governance has rolled out a rich set of digital services, established digital transformation policies, and expedited the development of various digital infrastructures. These initiatives have a positive and tangible impact on the Greek society and are well accepted by the citizens. The country has recently released a detailed digital transformation roadmap as part of the country's digital transformation strategy that is conveniently called \"Digital Book\".  In this context, AI can serve as a catalyst for the accelerated implementation of the on-going digital transformation of the country.\n",
    " Boosting EU Values and Fundamental Rights: As the birthplace of democracy, Greece has always had an instrumental role in shaping and boosting EU values. Therefore, developing AI systems and solutions that respect fundamental rights and democratic values, comply with European legislation, and benefit the society without exclusions as well as the environment is a priority that inspires the Greek society. In addition to embracing these values in its national AI ecosystem, Greece plans to undertake a pioneering role in spreading them across the entire EU AI ecosystem.  \n",
    "To successfully address the above listed socio-economic priorities the strategy sets three top-level objectives being:\n",
    " A Strategy for AI-based Economic Growth: The strategy aims at stimulating growth in the private sector of the economy, using AI as a catalyst for improving the competitiveness of Greek businesses. It includes activities that facilitate AI adoption by private enterprises, as well as actions aiming at attracting private sector investment. The collaboration of the AI research community with the private sector is strongly encouraged and facilitated.  Emphasis is paid in activities that support innovative SMEs (including high-tech) start-ups to develop novel AI solutions that could have a global impact. In this direction, the strategy capitalizes on Greece's vibrant start-ups ecosystem.\n",
    " Accelerated Transformation of the Greek Public Sector: As part of this objective, the strategy aims at accelerating the on-going digital transformation of the public administration using AI as a disruptive digital enabler. In this direction a rich set of reference projects are described, including projects with a tangible impact on the effectiveness of the public administration, the quality of services offered to citizens, as well as on the resilience of the country's infrastructures. Actions that foster the capacity of the public administration to implement AI projects are also proposed, along with projects that build trust among citizens regarding the adoption and use of AI. The strategy is perfectly aligned to the country's Digital Book and the projects described therein. Moreover, it leverages on-going digital transformation initiatives as a means of rapidly bootstrapping the development of AI projects and maximizing their value for money.  \n",
    " \"AI Democratisation\" with Greece in a Leading Role:  This strategic objective aims at establishing a unique socio-technical and legal environment for the development of ethical, trustworthy, democratic, and responsible AI systems that are accessible and beneficial to all citizens, while boosting sustainable and inclusive growth. The overarching target is to ensure that fundamental rights and democratic values of the citizens are always respected, fully in-line with EU values. As part of this objective, the strategy sets the ambitious and visionary target of establishing Greece as a leader in the Democratization of AI in EU, through a value-centric democratic and democratised approach to AI that will be adopted through the implementation of pioneering projects that will provide unique social, technological and sustainability showcases. In addition to these, an aggressive strategy for internationalizing these projects and boosting the EU-level standardization of an \"AI Democratization\" framework is developed.\n",
    "To accomplish these objectives, the strategy identifies and leverages the core competencies of the country, while planning for the mitigation of possible risks. Most importantly the strategy plans to develop complementary assets for AI development and adoption, including the required technological infrastructures and human capital. Emphasis is also paid in the development of a unique legal and regulatory framework, which will be aligned to EU values and regulations, while boosting the country's ambitious goals for an Ethical, Responsible and Democratic AI.\n",
    "The key projects and actions of the strategy are structured around three high level policy areas, namely AI Enabling Framework (Policy Area I); AI for Economic Growth and Digital Transformation (Policy Area II) and AI Principles (Policy Area III), which include the six following fine-grained Strategic Targets (STs): \n",
    "Policy Area I: AI Enabling Framework, including: (i) ST1: The Development of National AI Infrastructure, which includes actions that aim at creating or enhancing AI infrastructures like databases, supercomputers, and experimentation infrastructures; (ii) ST2: AI Research, Education & Skills Capital, which focuses on the development of the human capital needed for the successful development, deployment, operation of AI systems; and (iii) ST3: AI Innovation Ecosystem, which comprises activities that foster the creation of a vibrant AI innovation ecosystem that will provide growth opportunities to suppliers of AI solutions. \n",
    "Policy Area II: AI for Economic Growth and Digital Transformation, including: (i) ST4: AI for the Private Sector, which aggregates the full range of activities that are destined to boost AI-based private sector growth. It comprises actions that encourage and facilitate data sharing in the private sector, along with activities that support enterprises in accessing AI resources; and (ii) ST5: AI for the Public Administration, which includes the implementation of reference AI projects in the public administration, along with actions that unlock the innovation capacity of the public administration. The planned activities are streamlined with the digital transformation activities of the country as reflected in the \"Digital Book\".\n",
    "Policy Area III: AI Principles, including: (i) ST6: Ethical, Trustworthy and Democratic AI for All, which comprises technical, legal, and regulatory development activities towards ethical, responsible, and inclusive AI systems. Innovative and pioneering projects (e.g., the development of an \"Ethical AI Label\") are foreseen towards setting Greece apart in the development of AI systems that respect EU values and citizens' fundamental rights. \n",
    "For the effective implementation of the strategy, the following governance-related instruments and institutional initiatives will be established:\n",
    " An Inter-ministerial Committee, which will have the mandate to take and implement political decisions (including funding allocation decisions) associated with the implementation and continuous improvement of the strategy.\n",
    " A Supervising Committee within the Ministry of Digital Governance, which will be in charge of supervising and coordinating the implementation of the strategy. It will centralize and consolidate the interactions with other main bodies of the strategy, while at the same time ensuring the availability of timely and up-to-date information about the progress of the strategy's implementation.\n",
    " The AI Politeia, an Independent Body comprising experts from multiple disciplines, which will provide strategic guidance and recommendations about the implementation of the strategy, including recommendations about the specific actions to be implemented, funding decisions, compliance to the legal and regulatory framework and more. The AI Politeia will have the mandate to establish expert subcommittees to deal with specialized areas of the AI strategy. Upon its launch it will establish six subcommittees for each one of the six Strategic Targets (STs).  \n",
    " A National AI Marketplace that will serve as a single access point to AI resources in the country, including datasets, data catalogues, Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, success stories, catalogues of national infrastructures and more. The marketplace will also centralize access to information about AI-related funding opportunities for all different stakeholders.\n",
    " An AI Observatory destined to monitor the AI activities of the strategy and their implementation progress based on tangible KPIs.\n",
    " An AI Academy as the segment of the National Digital Academy that will oversee the AI- related education and training activities of the public sector.\n",
    " A National Legal and Regulatory Framework which will be developed in line with European principles and applicable laws and regulations. \n",
    " A National Committee for Technoethics and Bioethics that will provide ethics requirements and will audit the trustworthiness of AI systems and applications thereof, as well as whether they are aligned with the necessary ethical, trustworthy, democratic, and legal principles. \n",
    "The timely and adequate funding of the strategy will be based on financing from the following four main sources: (i) The new established Phaistos Fund of the Ministry of Digital Governance; (ii) The ESPA Program 2021-2027; (iii) EU funds from programs such as Horizon Europe, the Connecting Europe Facility, and other EU programs; and (iv) Private Sector Funding.\n",
    "The present document represents the first release of the Strategy.  This release will be accompanied with a detailed action plan, including specific projects that will implement the strategic directions presented in the Strategy. This detailed action plan will be made publicly available later in 2021. Furthermore, the Ministry of Digital Governance is committed to continually monitoring the implementation of the strategy, as a means of assessing its progress, revising its contents, and taking corrective action when required. The present document is therefore the initial version of a \"living\" document that will be regularly updated subject to a continuous improvement discipline.  Overall, this strategy aspires to provide a sound basis for creating a vibrant AI ecosystem that will benefit the Greek Society and Economy, while providing a unique contribution to EU's Strategic Targets for AI, notably in terms of the EU-wide \"Democratisation\" of AI. \n",
    " \n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the theory and development of systems and methods that can perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence. AI, including Machine Learning (ML) have started to transform the global economy.  It can be seen as a new industry in its own right, whilst transforming business models across sectors. Advances in computing and the increasing availability of data are key drivers of the current upsurge of AI [EC-COM(2020)65]. \n",
    "Europe targets to combine its technological and industrial strengths with a high-quality digital infrastructure and a regulatory framework based on its fundamental values to become a global leader in innovation in AI and its applications to the whole of European society and economy. Europe has set up the objective to improve citizens' way of living, by generating AI-enabled infrastructures and policies that are able to produce new products and services in various areas, including healthcare, education, public/civil/governmental/citizen-oriented services, transport, farming, the green and circular economy, fashion and tourism, as well as to optimise operational conditions, thus reducing costs, energy and waste, equipping law enforcement authorities with appropriate tools to ensure the security of citizens and respect their rights and freedoms. \n",
    "Given the major impact that AI can have on our society and the need to build trust, it is vital that AI is grounded in our values and fundamental rights, such as human dignity and privacy protection. Furthermore, the impact of AI systems should be considered not only from an individual perspective, but also from the perspective of the society as a whole. The use of AI systems can have a significant role in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and in supporting the democratic process and social rights, while taking into account all environmental impacts. As digital technology becomes an ever more central part of every aspect of people's lives, people should be able to trust it. Trustworthiness is a prerequisite for AI uptake [EC-COM(2020)65]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1: Hellenic National AI Strategy, a dynamic and evolving process \n",
    "The development of the National Strategy of AI took place during 2020. It is a result of the collaboration of some of the most prominent AI experts in the country, which worked together under the auspices and supervision of the Ministry of Digital Governance. The team that developed the strategy is a multi-disciplinary one, with a strong understanding of the peculiarities of the Greek environment and active participation in most of the AI-related initiatives of the country. Specifically, the team in charge of the strategy has a strong footprint in major digital transformation initiatives, data economy projects, supercomputing initiatives and the AI research projects in both Greece and EU. The development of the strategy has taken into account numerous key policy documents and relevant background studies ([EC-COM(2018)237], [EC-COM(2018)795], [HLEG19a], [HLEG19b], [Accenture19], [NCSRD20a], [BCG20], [SEV20], [Berlin20], [NCSRD20b], among others) regarding the pressing socio-economic challenges of the country, the role of digital transformation in addressing these challenges as well as European and International AI strategic best practices1. It has also considered recommendation for the development of Greece's national strategy provided in the scope of the close collaboration of the Ministry of Digital Governance with DG REFORM [EXPFR2020].\n",
    "1.2 DRIVING PRINCIPLES\n",
    "The development of the strategy has been driven by the following top-level principles:\n",
    "1) Alignment to the European Strategy for AI, which reflects the European Values and European Innovation Strategy [EC-COM (2020)65]. The present strategy is in-line with EU's strategy for AI, as the latter is reflected in relevant policy documents and AI-related consultations between member states. \n",
    "2) Streamlining of AI activities with Greece's Digital Transformation Strategy. The activities of the strategy benefit from their alignment with on-going and planned activities for the wider Digital Transformation of the country.  A rich set of such activities are included in the country's Digital Book, which has been recently put into public consultation by the Ministry of Digital Governance2. The alignment of the strategy to the Digital Book is aimed at taking advantage of the country's significant digital transformation momentum, making best use of the available resources, and maximizing the value for money of the strategy. \n",
    "3) Addressing the country's peculiar needs and priorities. Much as the strategy takes into account international best practices, it also considers the peculiarities of the country, including Greece's strengths and weaknesses in terms of AI development. Specifically, the strategy leverages strengths such as Greece's prominent positioning in various AI-related European initiatives (e.g., AI4EU), the excellent research community of the country, as well as the country's vibrant and growing start-up community. However, it also attempts to alleviate weaknesses such as its rather weak innovation ecosystem and its low ranking in the DESI index.\n",
    "4) Pursuing a practical approach that emphasizes implementation and tangible outcomes. The strategy includes a very rich set of concrete actions and practical AI projects, which will help the country progress in a tangible way. In a sense, the Strategy is largely practical, and project based. \n",
    "1.3 THE STRATEGY'S MAIN OBJECTIVES\n",
    "The National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence defines the framework and the policy for developing and implementing AI in Greece, structured in a set of coordinated and interconnected actions, with the clear aim of maximising potential benefits and minimising potential pitfalls for the economy and society. \n",
    "The strategy is aligned to the EU policies and recommendations for AI, as well as to relevant initiatives (e.g., AI4EU, Open-DEI and the EU HLEG expert group). Moreover, its development has considered international best practices from the strategies of other EU-27 countries and the UK [AIWatch2020], as well as from other prominent AI strategies outside the EU. However, the development of the strategy is primarily driven by the socio-economic priorities of the country, including Economic Growth, Digital Transformation and the promotion of EU Values and Fundamental Rights.\n",
    "To successfully address these priorities, the Strategy sets three core objectives, namely the formulation of a roadmap for AI-driven economic growth, the acceleration of the digital transformation of the Public Sector, and the Democratisation of AI, with Greece having a leading role in the global efforts towards the latter. The rest of the chapter provides details on the methodology followed for producing an actionable implementation strategy for realising these core objectives.\n",
    "1.4 STRUCTURE OF THE DOCUMENT\n",
    "The rest of the document is organised as follows: Chapter 2 provides a detailed overview of the Strategy's vision and goals, as well as the methodology to be adopted for its implementation. Chapter 3 illustrates the Governance of the Strategy, including some institutional bodies and infrastructures that will be established to support it.  Chapters 4-9 are devoted to the presentation of each one of the main Strategic Targets. Each chapter includes a set of detailed actions that are planned towards achieving each target. Chapter 10 is the final and concluding version of the strategy, which summarizes the key strategic objectives and how they reinforce each other. \n",
    "2. VISION \n",
    "2.1  OVERVIEW OF GREECE'S AI VISION\n",
    "Democratising AI: towards a technology-enabled future\n",
    "that is more democratic, just, equitable and sustainable for all and for good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to solve a wide range of societal, health and environmental challenges, and bring about significant positive changes in work and society. At the same time, AI entails numerous potential risks related to discrimination, intrusion, individual and collective social harms, and loss of liberty and autonomy, among others. These risks are appliable not only in the more far-fetched scenarios of fully autonomous AI systems, but also in the more common form of AI systems that operate under human oversights (i.e., human-in-the-loop scenarios). However, the ability of AI to realise its full potential, depends on the way that we will choose to seize this opportunity and address the challenges of this technological revolution, that are far more human, like rights, values, ethics, and governance, as societies and global community [NCSRD20a].\n",
    "Recognising the importance and the potential of AI as well as the possible challenges and risks, Greece aims to foster a technology-enabled future that embraces responsible AI innovation that respects and promotes the rights, freedoms, democratic values and welfare of humans and nature at all times. Towards this aim, Greece will harness the opportunity of Artificial Intelligence for economic, social, environmental growth and prosperity, based on a value-centric sustainable approach, promoting the development and deployment of AI in a trustworthy, democratised, and sustainable way for all, and for the shared common good.  \n",
    "The exploitation of an ethical and democratic AI for economic growth and for more effective digitization of the public administration are two of the core goals of the strategy, destined to benefit the country and its citizens. Beyond these important targets, Greece sets the goal of becoming an active and prominent contributor to democratizing AI at EU level, through engaging in relevant technology development, policy incubation, and standardization. To pursue its AI democratization goals, Greece sets more visionary targets in this area. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Vision for Greece\n",
    "\"Pursuing an AI advantage by innovating on our core values, which constitute our shared European values, the values and moral ideals of Democracy\"\n",
    "Values and moral ideals become more relevant in the AI era, as we are confronted with overwhelming negative changes in security, economic, political, health and environmental affairs. An era where more than ever before, we need to protect and promote the freedoms, rights, interests, values and welfare of humans and nature. As such, for Artificial Intelligence to become a promise of good for all and not a threat for our current and future societies, we need to rely on our shared principles and values [NCSRD20a].\n",
    "The vision is for Greece to become one of world's top experimental laboratories for the sustainable democratisation of AI and the infusion of AI with the rights, freedoms, and values of democracy by design.\n",
    "Greece aims at:\n",
    " Being a leading contributor in democratising AI and placing it at the service of people, society, and the environment, while accelerating the design, development and deployment of responsible, inclusive, democratic AI-driven innovation that is socially- and environmentally friendly by-design and\n",
    " Embedding the moral ideals, values, and rights of Democracy in AI by design (democratic AI-by-design), in both automated and human in the loop scenarios.\n",
    "Creating this way, the necessary conditions for the development and the deployment of AI in a trustworthy, democratised, and responsible way, that embeds the rights, freedoms, moral ideals, and values of Democracy in AI by design [NCSRD20a].  AI by design will be a catalyst for the creation of trust, which will greatly support the accelerated adoption of AI solutions by governmental and industrial organizations. In this way, the democratization pillar of the strategy will reinforce the economic development and digital transformation targets of the strategy as well.\n",
    "Greece intends to create a relevant socio-economic and technological environment for its own country.  However, it also aims at playing an active role in relevant technological developments, policy making and standardization at EU level. In this direction, the strategy prescribes several pioneering projects that address technological, policy and regulatory developments in an integrated way.  \n",
    "The strategy's emphasis on Democratic AI will be pursued based on a holistic approach comprising:\n",
    " Scientific and technological developments that support the democratic values of AI, such as transparency and trustworthiness. For example, research and technological developments leading to Explainable AI algorithms that boost the transparency of AI systems are emphasized in the strategy. Similarly, AutoML approaches that reduce the complexity of AI developments and make Machine Learning and Deep Learning broadly accessible to Domain Experts will be pursued as well.\n",
    " Development of ethical standards and blueprints, including for example a label for Ethical and Democratic AI and a regulatory framework that safeguards ethical values and respects citizens' rights.\n",
    " Establishment of institutions that will provide requirements and will audit AI systems against their adherence to ethical principles. \n",
    "As an experimental laboratory for the sustainable AI democratisation, Greece will stimulate AI-driven innovation with democratic ethos, respectful of the rights, freedoms, and European principles for Trustworthy AI. Towards this aim, an AI culture and an inclusive AI empowered social infrastructure will be fostered in order to enhance the adoption and become a value co-creator of responsible, democratic AI innovation [NCSRD20a]. This will be supported with the creation of testbeds and sandboxes for inclusive AI experimentation across technological, regulatory, business, ethical and democratic components of AI systems. Sandboxes will be fully aligned to the European and global practices so as to support the regulatory alignment of both startups and scale ups beyond their immediate local markets. The necessary incentives will also be provided to nurture such a participatory co-creation of value, anchored upon the needs of people, society, and the environment. The experimentation outputs will provide evidence-based findings that will enrich the design of future AI-driven innovations as well as research and policy actions.\n",
    "This value-centric democratic and democratised approach to AI that respects and promotes rights, freedoms and our shared values could serve as an example of a good practice for EU and the world.\n",
    "2.1.1 GOALS\n",
    "Greece's visionary democratization targets will contribute to the ever-important economic growth and public sector transformation goals of the strategy. Specifically, AI-by design will become a catalyst for fostering trust between the various stakeholders including citizens, private sector enterprises and the public administration. At the same time, Greece's active participation in the developments of an ethical and democratic AI at EU scale is expected to contribute to improving the positive economic outputs for the country. Demand for technologies, policies, and standards for ethical and trusted AI is expected to increase in the coming years. Greece can serve as a provider of value-added services in this area, including provider of knowhow, expertise, technologies, and policy-related best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2: Short-Term, Medium-Term and Long-Term Targets of the Strategy Regarding AI Democratization\n",
    "Our main AI \"democratization\" goals to reach between 2021 and 2030 are set out in the following table, and will be achieved through a set of specific strategic targets and actions detailed in the following chapters. An agile, iterative \"test and learn\" approach will be utilised in order to realise the envisioned benefits in the most efficient way.\n",
    "The aspirational vision for Greece, is the longer-term outlook that aims to create a technology-enabled future and an AI society that is more democratic, just, equitable and sustainable for all and for the common good. The corresponding vision addresses three key AI policy areas, AI infrastructural enablers, AI application areas and AI principles.\n",

    "2.1.2 REMOVING BARRIERS AND ADDRESSING KEY CHALLENGES\n",
    "In order to realise the full potential of AI in Greece, it is important to address the challenges that emerge in a number of areas. \n",
    " Need for an ethical, trustworthy and democratic framework for artificial intelligence: Aligned with the Berlin Declaration, \"we need a compass to navigate the digital transition, aligned by our common European fundamental rights and values and shaped by participatory processes that to some extent may themselves need to be redesigned by involving citizens and the general public in open consultations, online and offline\". Thus, fostering the right frameworks to ensure participatory, ethical, trustworthy, and democratic AI is crucial. \n",
    " Need for data quality and quantity for artificial intelligence: Demand for more and good quality data to train algorithms, is increasing. Inability to find data, constitutes a barrier to developing AI solutions that use for example the Greek language. \n",
    " Need for multidisciplinary AI related skills: To deliver the potential of AI, there is a need for specialised skill as well as better combination of business and technical skills. Both public and private organisations, regardless of their size will not be able to realise AI's full potential, unless they invest in their skills capital (upskilling, reskilling). In addition, creating a life-long skill development culture is also important for individuals and civil society at large.   \n",
    " Need to create trust: Enhancing AI adoption means that AI needs to be trusted and be ethical by design respecting fundamental rights, freedoms and democratic values. Trust in AI involves all stakeholder segments from people, to organisations, to public sector administrations and society at large. Building trust in AI implies the creation of the necessary conditions that will ensure full confidence in the protection of data, rights, freedoms, and values as well as the processes that will enable transparent, explainable, and accountable AI innovation.\n",
    " Need for higher level of investment: Greece ranks lower, in comparison to other countries with regards to private investment in AI. This means that we need to exploit the country's digital transformation momentum and to strengthen existing reforms that could stimulate private investment in AI. Moreover, the establishment of public private partnerships for AI must be actively pursued. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 STRATEGIC PILLARS \n",
    "The Strategy includes three key Policy Areas (Figure 3) that are important for realising our Strategic Vision and boosting adoption, innovation, and investment. These areas are sub-divided into six Strategic Targets: \n",
    "1. Policy Area I: AI Enabling Framework. Including computing and data Infrastructures (Strategic Target 1), Research, Education, Skills Capital initiatives (Strategic Target 2), and the nourishment and support of the National AI Innovation ecosystem (Strategic Target 3). \n",
    "2. Policy Area II: AI for Economic Growth and Digital Transformation. Focusing on the Private sector (Strategic Target 4), and the Public sector (Strategic Target 5) digital transformation and growth. \n",
    "3. Policy Area III: AI Principles. As an overarching third policy area that highlights the importance of applying and supporting by design ethical, trustworthy, and democratic AI, respecting the rights, freedoms, democratic values and promoting the welfare of humans and nature at all times (Strategic Target 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3: The Three Policy Areas\n",
    "The three policy pillars aim to address the needs of all stakeholders such as the public and private sectors, the research and academic communities, civil society (including the natural environment) (adopting a quintuple helix model3).\n",
    "2.2.1 STRATEGIC POLICY PILLAR I\n",
    "Strategic Target 1: National AI Infrastructure\n",
    "The first Strategic Target focuses on AI infrastructures integrating both technological (i.e., software, hardware, networks) and data elements. This Strategic Target focuses on developing cutting-edge AI infrastructural components that will support the development, deployment, and operation of AI technologies, applications, and solutions at a national level. It creates the digital enablers that will lay the foundations for fostering a strong AI ecosystem in Greece.\n",
    "Strategic Target 2: AI Research, Education and Skills Capital\n",
    "Strategic Target 2 integrates three distinct and interrelated focal areas: Research, Education, and Skills capital. A cross-cutting theme that traverses all areas concerns talent development, retention, and attraction. This Strategic Target aims to create a climate that encourages and supports knowledge enhancement, upskilling, and research excellence, with the ultimate aim to equip Greece with citizens, workers, and leaders who are able to foster a value-driven AI future that will take advantage of new technologies for the common good. \n",
    "Strategic Target 3: AI Innovation Ecosystem\n",
    "A strong AI innovation ecosystem is a key enabling factor for economic and social growth. Strategic Target 3 aims to foster the creation of a sustainable and collaborative AI innovation ecosystem that will successfully interconnect all ecosystem stakeholders: entrepreneurs, innovators, investors, SMEs and large organisations, scientists, and research teams as well as regulators and policy makers and fuel AI-driven innovation that will benefit society as a whole. This Strategic Target will nurture the sustainable development of an inclusive and collaborative AI ecosystem in Greece. It will promote and facilitate the ability of Greek enterprises notably start-ups, to collaborate, develop and export globally competitive trustworthy AI products and services.\n",
    "2.2.2 STRATEGIC POLICY PILLAR II\n",
    "Strategic Target 4: AI for the Private Sector \n",
    "Strategic Target 4 aims to accelerate the adoption and use of AI in the private sector as an enabler of digital transformation and sustainable economic growth. This strategic target will increase the National AI and sectoral competitiveness (direct and indirect), drive an increase in GVA (Gross Value Added), and fundamentally facilitate the overall national digital transformation reforms. Aligned with our vision, the private sector will ensure that AI is placed at the service of the people, the society, and the environment, being democratic, trustworthy and sustainable for all for the shared common good.\n",
    "Strategic Target 5: AI for the Public Sector \n",
    "This Strategic Target focuses upon the development and deployment of AI technologies and systems in the context of the public sector. Taking advantage of the country's significant digital transformation momentum, AI will become the catalyst for accelerating the on-going digital transformation and administrative reform. As such, it will accelerate the implementation of the rich portfolio of ambitious digital transformation projects while at the same time, streamlined with the wider digital strategy of the country, it will enable public sector organisations to automate, optimise and enhance their processes and operations, leading to best use of available resources. Furthermore, the public sector has a role-model function in adopting a value-based culture for AI systems development and deployment, which is ethical and democratic-by-design while at the same time socially-good- and environmentally-friendly-by-design.\n",
    "2.2.3 STRATEGIC POLICY PILLAR III\n",
    "Strategic Target 6: Ethical, Trustworthy and Democratic AI for all \n",
    "The aim of this Strategic Target is to lay the foundations for ethical, trustworthy, and democratic AI, respecting the rights, freedoms, democratic values and always promoting the welfare of humans and nature. This Strategic will promote and enable the development and deployment of AI that is infused with the human rights, freedoms, and values of Democracy, and the welfare of humans and nature (socially-good-by-design and environmentally-friendly-by-design), while establishing the necessary frameworks for assessing and auditing AI systems (legal, ethical & democratic AI frameworks). Strategic Target 6 brings forward a range of innovative and pioneering projects such as the development of an 'Ethical and Democratic AI Label' that could springboard from Greece to the world.\n",

    "3. STRATEGY GOVERNANCE AND FINANCING \n",
    "3.1 AI STRATEGY GOVERNANCE\n",
    "3.1.1 PRINCIPLES OF THE STRATEGY'S GOVERNANCE\n",
    "The governance of the Strategy has been designed based on the following driving principles:\n",
    " Political Commitment and Responsibility: The governance bodies of the strategy include the actors that have the political mandate and responsibility for the implementation of the strategy. This is important for accelerating policies and decisions that are essential to the successful implementation of the strategy.\n",
    " Multi-disciplinarity and Inter-disciplinarity: The implementation of the strategy hinges on the engagement of experts from different disciplines, including for example computer science and AI experts, researchers, innovation management experts, legal and ethics experts, as well as experts in social security and the future of work. The governance structure makes provisions for the active engagement of experts from all these disciplines, while supporting their close and effective collaboration.  \n",
    " Continuous Improvement and Agility: The strategy emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement and fine tuning of the implementation actions, based on new requirements, the latest international developments, as well as feedback from the implementation of the various projects of the strategy. To this end, the governance structure makes provisions for the continuous monitoring of KPIs about the implementation of AI activities, including indicators about the growth of the Greek AI ecosystem and the overall socio-economic impact of the strategy. These KPIs will be accordingly exploited for data-driven, evidence-based decisions at the pollical level.\n",
    " Exploitation of readily available Structures, Institutions, and Expertise: To accelerate the implementation of the strategy and to maximize its value for money, the governance structure takes advances of existing institutional bodies and expertise in the country, including the expertise of AI centres, of the research and scientific community, as well as of governmental organizations with expertise in funding, monitoring, and supporting research and innovation activities.  In this context, the main institutional bodies of the Strategy will be implemented by existing actors with relevant expertise.\n",
    " Balancing Power of Different Actors, including actors from academia and industry: The governance structure aims at engaging all relevant stakeholders in a balanced fashion, including public and private sector actors, but also actors from both industry and academia. This is important to ensuring an inclusive approach that benefits the society as a whole and leaves no one behind.\n",
    " Linking of Political and Scientific Decisions with Funding Modalities: The timely and adequate funding of the various actions is key for the successful implementation of the strategy.  Therefore, the governance structure is directly linked to the national funding authorities that will undertake the implementation of funding decisions for projects of the strategy.\n",
    "3.1.2 GOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE - MAIN BODIES\n",
    "The governance structure of the strategy and its main bodies are depicted in  Figure 4. It comprises the following bodies:\n",
    " AI National Inter-ministerial Committee (AINIC): This is the main governing body of the strategy at the political level. It will be chaired by the Minister of Digital Governance and will consist of highest-level representatives (i.e., minister, deputy minister, general secretary) of the ministries directly involved in or affected by the implementation of the strategy. The AINIC will have the mandate to take and implement political decisions (including funding allocation decisions) associated with the implementation and continuous improvement of the AI strategy. The Supervising Committee of the Ministry of Digital Governance will supervise the implementation of the decisions of the Inter-ministerial committee. In order to take educated, evidence-based decisions, the Inter-ministerial Committee will have access to KPIs regarding the implementation of the strategy, which will be provided by the Ministry of Digital Governance. Furthermore, it will have direct interactions with AI Politeia towards soliciting and analysing expert feedback.\n",
    " Supervising Committee of the Ministry of Digital Governance: A specialized committee within the Ministry of Digital Governance will be established. It will be chaired by a Senior, Top-Level official of the Ministry. The Supervising Committee will supervise and coordinate the day-to-day implementation of the strategy. It will centralize and consolidate the interactions with other main bodies of the strategy, while at the same time ensuring the availability of timely and up-to-date information about the progress of the strategy's implementation. It will interact closely with the experts of the AI Politeia and with the AINIC. \n",
    "  AI Politeia - Advisory Board: This will be an Independent Body comprising experts from multiple disciplines, which will provide strategic guidance and recommendations about the implementation of the strategy. Specifically, the AI Politeia will make suggestions about specific actions to be implemented, the funding allocated to them, as well as potential funding sources. The AI Politeia will also provide recommendations and guidelines for compliance to the legal and regulatory framework of the strategy. Note that the role of the AI Politeia will be to provide guidance and recommendations. The final decisions about the implementation and funding of specific activities will be taken by the Inter-Ministerial Committee (AINIC). Furthermore, the AI Politeia will design and propose projects and action plans to the political actors (i.e., the Ministry of Digital Governance and the AINIC). The AI Politeia will consist of a minimum of six (6) members and a maximum of nine (9) members each one having a single vote. It will have the mandate to propose and endorse the creation of sub-committees that will take a leading role in specific areas of the strategy. A minimum of six subcommittees are envisaged, each one dedicated to each of the six strategic directions of the strategy i.e., AI Infrastructures (ST1), Research Education and Skills Capital (ST2), AI Innovation Ecosystem (ST3), AI for Private Sector and Economic Growth (ST4), AI for the Public Administration (ST5), as well as Ethical and Democratic AI (ST6). Each of the sub-committee will supervise the implementation of a specific direction as described above. The chairing persons of each Sub-Committee (SC) will be among the members of the AI Politeia, each having a single vote. The AI Politeia will have the mandate for recommending the establishment of additional subcommittees, in the form of working groups that will deal with specialized topics like sector specific activities under ST4 or specialized Ethical and Regulatory Actions under (ST6). The members of the AI Politeia will include top scientific and technological experts from the public and the private sector, notably globally renowned experts. Furthermore, the AI Politeia will reflect a balanced representation between academia and industry. National organizations and associations with prominent expertise on AI (e.g., AI laboratories, the Hellenic AI Society (EETN)) could have an active role in staffing and supporting the various Subcommittees of the AI Politeia.\n",
    " National Committee of Technoethics and Bioethics: A National Committee on Technoethics and Bioethics will be established. Its mission will be to advise the Greek state on ethical issues, with emphasis on issues arising from the adoption, deployment and use of novel technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and the Internet of Things. In the scope of the Strategy's governance the Committee will provide advice on ethical AI issues, including legal compliance auditing activities. Furthermore, it will have an active role in the specification of the national legal and regulatory framework for AI, while serving as an AI Auditing Body. Hence, it will also have supervisory, auditing and control responsibilities over AI technologies and solutions produced in the scope of the Greek AI ecosystem. More information about the Committee is provided in Table 2\n",
    " Hellenic AI Observatory: This observatory will be developed to centralize data gathering and evidence-based monitoring of the strategy, while facilitate value-adding interactions with Greek stakeholders and AI communities. The Observatory will provide information and KPIs about: (i) the AI activities in Greece, (ii) the AI ecosystem entities, (iii) the available AI training and educational activities that take place in Greece across all educational levels, including executive and public educational programmes, (iv) the AI research activities that take place in Greece in collaboration with various Greek Research Institutes, Universities, and the Hellenic AI Society (EETN), (v) AI success stories across different sectors (AI pioneers). The Observatory will keep track of information about AI activities in the Public Sector (i.e., actions of ST5), AI activities in the Private Sector (i.e., actions of ST4), AI Education and Research activities (i.e., actions of ST2), activities associated with the AI Innovation Ecosystem (i.e., actions of ST3), as well as about activities associated with the development of an Ethical, Trustworthy and Democratic AI (i.e., actions of ST6). Hence, the observatory will include a dedicated area for each one of the above activity types. The AI Hellenic Observatory is referenced in the actions planned for each one of the above-listed strategic targets. The National Data and Documentation Organization will be in charge of the implementation, establishment and operation of the Hellenic AI Observatory, leveraging its rich experience in monitoring and tracking KPIs about the Research and Innovation ecosystem of the country.\n",
    " National AI Marketplace: This will be the National portal and repository of AI resources. It will serve as a single access point to AI resources of the country, including datasets, data catalogues, Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, success stories, catalogues of national infrastructures and more. The Marketplace will provide single-access point to AI resources produced in Greece. The latter will include publicly accessible resources (e.g., AI models with an open license) and private resources (e.g., where access might be restricted). The National AI Marketplace will also centralize access to AI-related funding opportunities in Greece, including public tenders, calls for grant proposals, access to finance opportunities for SMEs etc. In this direction it will link to portals and repositories of other organizations, such as National Funding Authorities (e.g., PHAISTOS FUND), the European Commission, AI Centres and Digital Innovation Hubs.  Among other goals, the National AI Marketplace will serve the needs of Greece's AI Innovation Ecosystem. As such it will be established under the actions of ST3, yet it will be used by many different activities that will be implemented in the scope of the Strategy.  The National Data and Documentation Organization will be in charge of the implementation, establishment and operation of the National AI Marketplace, leveraging its rich experience in implementing repositories of digital assets.\n",
    "  AI Academy: The AI Academy will be a part (i.e., a chapter) of the National Digital Academy, which will be focused on AI. It will oversee the AI- related education and training activities of the public sector and citizens. On a merit and need basis the AI Academy will provide guidance and support about the planning of training and education activities from private sector actors.  As part of the National Digital Academy, the AI Academy will be supervised by EDYTE/GRNET, which will report to the Ministry of Digital Governance about the planning and execution of the AI-related training activities. EDYTE/GRNET is already in charge of organizing and supporting the National Digital Academy. The AI Academy is considered as an extension of on-going activities of the organization.\n",
    " AI Infrastructures Governance: EDYTE/GRNET will also supervise the operation of the National AI Infrastructures, including national databases and supercomputing infrastructures. EDYTE/GRNET is already in charge of the operation of the ARIS supercomputer. The AI Infrastructures Governance is considered as an extension of on-going activities of the organization.\n",
    " National Funding Authorities: The Ministry of Digital Governance will establish close links with National Funding Authorities as means of accelerating the implementation of the funding and co-funding programs that will support the implementation of the strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4: Governance structure of the National AI Strategy\n",
    "The National Committee of Technoethics and Bioethics\n",
    "In the scope of the National Strategy on AI, Greece is currently establishing a \"National Committee on Technoethics and Bioethics\". It will be an independent authority, which will consist of nine members, including one President and two Vice-Presidents, as in the case of the Hellenic Telecommunications and Post Commission. One of the Vice Presidents will be responsible for ethical, social, and legal issues arising from the applications of emerging Technologies with emphasis on Artificial Intelligence. The other Vice President will be responsible for ethical, social, and legal issues arising from Life Sciences applications with emphasis on biomedicine and genetics.  Beyond its advisory duties, the Committee will also have supervisory and control responsibilities. The latter will focus on the new forms of control required in the scope of high-risk AI applications, including for example AI applications associated with hate speech, misinformation, and propaganda activities. The Committee will also supervise and control activities that might raise issues associated with social inequalities and discrimination, invasion of privacy, personal autonomy, and fundamental human rights, as well as voter manipulation and electoral manipulation. Hence, it will also serve as a National AI Auditing Body. The Committee will have an active role in the aligning of AI developments in the Green ecosystem with the applicable laws, regulations and guidelines at the national and EU levels (e.g., alignment to the ethical AI guidelines of the HLEG). \n",
    "The National Committee will cooperate closely with other Ministries towards elaborating policy proposals and specific actions in technoethics and bioetchis. It will also cooperate with European and international organizations and will ensure Greece's participation in international events related on Ethical and Responsible AI.\n",
    "The members of the Committee will be internationally reknowned scholars from technoethics and bioethics related fields, such as law, technology, biomedicine, sociology, philosophy, etc. Furthermore, it will have a supporting and decisive role in both the formulation of relevant public policies and the development of public debates regarding with Ethical AI issues.\n",
    "The Committee may be established by extending the responsibilities of the existing National Bioethics Committee, which has been established in 1998 (Law 2667/1998). In this case, the National Bioethics Committee will be renamed to \"National Committee on Technoethics and Bioethics\" and will report directly to the Prime Minister's office. \n",
    "For the purposes of the AI National Strategy and until this new independent authority becomes fully functional, a Working Group under the Prime Minister could be established to perform the duties of the Committee in the transitional period.  This specific working group / committee will also undertake preparatory activities for the successful establishment of the National Technoecthics and Bioethics Committee.\n",
    "Table 2: Information about The National Committee of Technoethics and Bioethics\n",
    "As already outlined, the National Committee on Technoethics and Bioethics will serve a National AI Auditing Body. It will provide the requirements and audit the trustworthiness of AI systems, as well as their compliance with the necessary ethical and legal principles. It will also act as the National Advisory Committee on the development and implementation of ethical and democratic AI and will provide the required mechanisms to establish broad policy and legal principles for AI. It will provide the other bodies of the governance structure with advice on ways to optimize the development of artificial intelligence, to support the unbiased development and application of artificial intelligence, and to protect the fundamental rights, freedoms, and democratic values. This Auditing Body will ensure that ethical, social, and legal requirements are applied horizontally across all activities of the strategy. More details about the activities of the Committee are presented in the scope of the actions planned for ST6. Moreover, the Committee will ensure the ethical compliance of public sector activities as outlined in ST5.\n",
    "Key to the implementation of the strategy will be also the establishment of a rich set of experimentation infrastructures and testbeds, destined to serve all the different actors, including the public sector, the private sector, and the participants to the innovation ecosystem (e.g., Innovation Clusters, AI Centres, and Innovation Hubs). Different experimental infrastructures are described in following sections to serve the objectives of the strategy. The descriptions emphasize the experimentation capabilities that should be offered by the various research infrastructures, testbeds, and sandboxes. Nevertheless, the physical implementation and deployment of these infrastructures will consolidate and streamline the various functionalities as a means of maximizing value for money. \n",
    "More details on the role of the above-listed bodies and instruments are provided on the descriptions of the respective actions' projects foreseen in the Strategy. Likewise, these instruments are frequently referenced from later sections of the Strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 5: Implementation Strategy Lifecycle\n",
    "Furthermore, guidance and knowledge exchange mechanisms will be established with the relevant Sectoral Scientific Councils of the National Council for Research, Technology, and Innovation, (NCRI) and particularly the Council for Data Policy & AI. Scientific Councils support in specialised scientific domains the National Council, the Supreme Consultation Body of the Greek State for the formulation and implementation of the national policy for Research, Technology and Innovation. \n",
    "Based on the presented Governance Structure and the above-listed bodies, a participatory, iterative, and agile approach will be adopted. The approach will entail cross-functional implementation, rapid iterations, and continuous, collective feedback loops, allowing us to gain insight and stakeholder feedback from the implementation of the initial AI Strategic Actions across all Strategic Targets. This process will enable the country to quickly move forward - leapfrog- and facilitate evidence-based decision making for planning its long-term AI action plan.\n",
    "As the National Strategy is implemented and monitored by the presented Governance structure, and the local and global AI landscape evolves, the Strategy itself will be re-evaluated and possibly re-calibrated to incorporate changes and corrective actions. These will be applied by the Ministry of Digital Governance and the competent Bodies - Committees after consultation and collection of all relevant data, under the guidance of the Inter-ministerial Committee.\n",
    "3.2 FUNDING OF THE STRATEGY\n",
    "Key to the successful implementation of the strategy is its timely and adequate financing. The financing of the strategy will be based on the following streams of funding:\n",
    " Phaistos Fund: Phaistos is a recently established fund, based on law 4727/2020. The mission of the fund is to support 5G R&I activities, including 5G enabled applications. Various AI applications can benefit from 5G infrastructures and therefore the fund provides an excellent opportunity for financing AI technologies and use cases. As such the fund will be one of the primary funding instruments for the activities of the National Strategy on AI. An overview of the fund and of its relevance to the AI strategy are provided in Table 3.\n",
    " ESPA Program 2021-2027: A significant number of researches, development, innovation and education programs will be financed through the ESPA (Partnership for Growth Framework) 2021-2027. \n",
    " EU Level Financing: The Strategy aims at exploiting EU-level funds and financing instruments, such the Horizon Europe program, grants of the European Defence Agency, programs of the Connecting Europe Facility, the Recovery and Resilience Facility, and others.\n",
    " Private Sector Funding: One of the main goals of the strategy is to stimulate private investments on AI-related projects and technologies, including national and foreign investments. Later chapters present several AI-related investments (e.g., the establishment of Microsoft's Data Centre for South-eastern in Greece), which represent recent success stories and act as forerunner investments that boost the goals of the strategy.\n",
    "The Phaistos Fund \n",
    "The \"Phaistos Fund\" was established with article 93 of law 4727/2020. It is a Venture Capital the structure of which is described in article 7 of law 2992/2002. The Phaistos fund is expected to become one of the primary funding sources for SME and enterprises involved with activities of the National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence. It has been recently set up with the following objectives:\n",
    " To drive the country's digital transformation and competitiveness. \n",
    " To boost and attract investments in technological areas with significant multiplier effects on the Greek economy such as 5G networking and related applications.\n",
    " To formulate a \"Profit Platform\" with the Greek state as the main beneficiary. \n",
    " To facilitate growth for businesses of the national ecosystem in a tangible and substantial way.\n",
    " To take state services at the forefront of market's benchmarks.\n",
    "The fund is primarily designed to finance activities that will boost the utilization of 5G networks. As such it will support technological activities in 5G networking and adjacent exponential technologies, such as Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data. The latter are directly linked to some of the core activities of the National AI strategy, notably activities that are aimed at supporting the transition to a data economy and at deploying novel AI applications for the private sector, the public administration, and the national AI innovation ecosystem. The mission of the fund puts emphasis on applications in specific economic sectors, such as transport and logistics, manufacturing, defense, utilities, health, and tourism. Nevertheless, applications in other sectors can be supported as well.\n",
    "The Phaistos fund capital will derive 25% of the state revenues from the 5G license auction that took place in December constituting an initial capital of more than €90 million for the fund. This capital will leverage additional private capital from investors at a height of 30 million€- 40 million€.\n",
    "From a governance point of view, the fund is a legal entity that will be controlled by the Hellenic Company of Assets and Participations4. Phaistos started its operations in January 2021 and is expected to support an initial pool of innovation projects and activities that will be implemented by universities, startups, and state-owned enterprises.  To support relevant 5G applications, the Hellenic Telecoms and Post Commission (EETT) has reserved spectrum in low, mid, and high frequency bands.  This spectrum will be made available free of charge for 12 months, for pilot implementations during the services development process from investees. These initial projects will act as catalysts that will unblock the fund's potential to support private sector activities and attract relevant investments.\n",
    "Overall, the Phaistos Fund is an effective bridge between state and private investments, it combines the best of the two worlds, and offers unique capabilities for financing technological innovations. Based on its focus on 5G and related technologies (including AI), it is best positioned to produce remarkable returns and to boost national economic growth.  The overall approach of the fund approach is considered a novelty at EU level.\n",
    "Table 3: Overview of the Phaistos Fund and its relevance to the National AI Strategy\n",
    "3.3 PARTICIPATION IN INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES AND CONSULTATION BODIES\n",
    "An important factor for the evolution and implementation of the strategy is the country's presence in initiatives and actions that will contribute to the formulation of the global AI landscape. Greece's aspiration to lead in the democratisation of AI will be greatly facilitated by its active involvement in projects, partnerships and actions driven by the Berlin Declaration on Digital Society [Berlin20].\n",
    "Greece already participates actively in various EU level AI initiatives spanning research, technological and regulatory issues. This participation will be reinforced to ensure that the activities of the strategy are aligned to European mandates and best practices. Specifically, the regulatory activities of the strategy (foreseen in ST4 and ST6) will be fully aligned to European laws, regulations, and guidelines. Moreover, the National AI Marketplace will be linked to EU marketplaces and repositories of AI resources, to allow Greece act as both contributor and user of these marketplaces. Similarly, various Strategic Targets will be served via knowledge and technology exchange in the context of global alliances such as the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI)5, with explicit focus on the development and promotion of Trustworthy AI solutions. \n",
    "Greece will also contribute on AI issues to several bodies where the country is officially a member, including the OECD, Council of Europe, the ILO, the WEF, the Digital Europe, and the European AI Alliance. Emphasis will be also paid in presenting and communicating novel outcomes of the country in Ethical and Democratic AI issues in these bodies. In this direction, the public sector will actively participate in relevant meetings, while private sectors entities will be also encouraged to participate and take an active role where applicable. \n",
    "4. STRATEGIC TARGET 1 (ST1): NATIONAL AI INFRASTRUCTURES\n",
    "4.1 CURRENT STATUS - OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\n",
    "Greece has developed various infrastructures which are related to AI and can support the development of a national AI ecosystem in the next years, leveraging also the opportunities created by recent efforts and initiatives, such as the Book for Greece's Digital Transformation. In the following, we provide a brief overview.\n",
    " Data infrastructures. A central catalogue for public open data of the Greek government has been setup (data.gov.gr), comprising over 10,400 datasets from 340 public organizations. Public sector organizations are continuously making available open datasets, according to national law 4305/2014 which mandates that open governmental datasets should be available to citizens in-line with FAIR information practices. Moreover, the \"Diavgeia\" platform (diavgeia.gov.gr) has been developed as part of the \"Transparency Program initiative\", which obliges all government institutions to upload their acts and decisions on the Internet, with special attention to issues of national security and sensitive personal data. Other initiatives include registries and data catalogues maintained by various authorities, such as the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT), the Hellenic Manpower Employment Organization (OAED), the National Social Security Entity (EFKA), the General Electronic Commercial Registry (GEMI), the e-Prescription service by IDIKA SA, etc. Data catalogues and repositories for geospatial and scientific data have also been developed (e.g., geodata.gov.gr, hellenicdataservice.gr). Finally, gov.gr is Greece's public sector information website, providing a single point of access to the full range of Digital Services of the Greek Government.\n",
    " Cloud infrastructures. All e-platforms run by state services and agencies are gradually moved to the country's government cloud (G-Cloud) infrastructure. The migration of legacy applications to the central infrastructure of the G-Cloud, which is managed by the General Secretariat for Public Administration Information Systems (GSISPA), is on-going. Public sector databases are also migrated to the GSISPA data centres and a data consolidation policy is implemented. The migration is supported by relevant national legislation (law 4623/2019). GRNET offers the Okeanos Public Cloud, which comprises over 400,000 Virtual Machines spawned, as well as four Data Centres. Moreover, GRNET provides high performance computing resources to the Greek and international scientific and research communities to support them in their scientific research endeavours. These services are provided based on the ARIS supercomputing infrastructure. \n",
    " 5G networks. The Greek legal framework for 5G has been defined and the respective legislation has been published (L. 4727/2020). Greece's National Telecommunications & Post Commission (EETT) has announced the auction of 5G wireless spectrum. Spectra across low, mid and high spectrum ranges are available in order to deliver widespread coverage and support all 5G use cases. The sale includes frequencies in the 700MHz, 2GHz, 3.4GHz-3.8GHz and 26GHz bands (L. 4727/2020). Superfast Broadband (SFBB) and UltraFast Broadband is currently ongoing in order to establish a favourable environment for private investment in 5G.\n",
    "Based on the existing landscape, as summarized above, we next outline several opportunities and challenges that arise with respect to the national AI infrastructures.\n",
    "Data infrastructures: Over the past decade, several successful initiatives have been undertaken for creating open data catalogues for the public sector and the scientific community (e.g., data.gov.gr, geodata.gov.gr, HELIX). This ensures significant expertise and mature technologies for open data publishing, which creates opportunities for economies of scale and added value while avoiding duplication of effort and resources. In particular, Gov e-Health platforms (ePrescription by IDIKA SA) maintain valuable information that can be used to support decision making for national health policies and expand and improve the provision of national health services. Also, they can foster data-driven R&I activities, and further strengthen synergies between health insurance organisations, the Ministry of Health, and supervising authorities, while providing transparency and accountability not only to citizens but to all involved stakeholders. Finally, it is worth noting that Greek organizations (e.g., University of Athens, ATHENA RC) have leading roles in EU-wide initiatives and projects related to open data and open science (e.g., OpenAIRE). Notably, ATHENA RC coordinates CLARIN:EL, the National Infrastructure for Language Resources and Technologies, which is the Greek part of the CLARIN ERIC European Infrastructure, a pan-European network of universities, research centres and institutions in this field. Still, to build precise and useful AI solutions, organizations not only need a lot of data, but also accurate data that is appropriately structured and labelled. Low-quality data typically lead to undesirable or unreliable outcomes. However, quality indicators for the published data are typically not available. Thus, technical challenges such as interoperability, data verification and provenance support, quality and accuracy, decentralised data sharing and processing architectures, and maturity and uptake of privacy-preserving technologies for big data will have a direct impact on the potential value of data made available for sharing. Moreover, beyond open data, a data economy also relies upon the availability of proprietary data owned by stakeholders in various value chains. There are however important business, organisational and legal constraints that can block this, such as the lack of motivation to share data due to ownership concerns; loss of control; lack of trust; the lack of foresight in not understanding the value of data or its sharing potential; the lack of data valuation standards in marketplaces; the legal blocks to the free flow of data and the uncertainty around data policies. There is a major barrier to the adoption of data sharing strategies and business models. \n",
    "Cloud infrastructures: GRNET's supercomputing infrastructure ARIS can serve as a basis for supporting the research and academic community in scaling-up their application development efforts, as part of Greece's National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence. There are already plans to expand the capacity of the existing supercomputing infrastructure, which should consider the need to support AI research and development. It is also worth noting that among the Okeanos data centres, the one in Louros area is managed based on green practices (i.e., it is a green data centre) as its operation leverages Renewable Energy Sources. This can serve as a best practice for the next generation of Green data centres that will support AI applications. Moreover, GRNET's Harmoni platform provides a concrete example of a large-scale database, which could serve as a basis for developing novel AI-based healthcare applications. G-Cloud also has the opportunity to become a one-stop-shop to access raw (properly anonymized, etc) data that are produced by the deployed services. Greece can also benefit from access to Pan-European HPC infrastructures through its participation in relevant EU initiatives such as PRACE (through GRNET). Moreover, Greece has the unique opportunity to benefit from the strong presence of Greek HPC stakeholders (Institutions such as, GRNET, FORTH, NTUA, NCSR-D, AUTH in cooperation with Greek SMEs such as, Exapsys) in pan-European supercomputing initiatives with leading roles. For instance, the country participates in the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, where its contributions to supercomputing research projects rank fifth among all European countries. As of the writing of this document, Greek HPC stakeholders participate in the following EuroHPC JU funded projects that either have started or have been selected to start: EuroCC National Competence Center, Leonardo, DEEP-SEA, RED-SEA, eProcessor, DComEX, ACROSS. The country has also a strong presence in other EU-funded HPC research activities, such as the European Processor Initiative, Exanest and EuroExa projects. Last but not least, Greek Supercomputing stakeholders (FORTH, NTUA), in collaboration with Greek HPC and AI SMEs (SunlightIO, Space Hellas) participate in European-wide Large-Scale Testbeds that bring together HPC and Big Data, such as the Evolve project. Ultimately, all these activities result in Greece's recognition as one of the top European countries in research and development in the technologies of Supercomputers and large Data Centres. \n",
    "Among the challenges to be tackled is that of \"connecting\" separate physical locations between the storage infrastructure of the data owners and the computing infrastructure that can be used for processing, taking into consideration that computing infrastructures need to have access to the required data. This challenge is both regulatory and technical. Another challenge stems from the fact that users of supercomputers typically develop their code in low level frameworks, whereas most data-driven applications depend on productivity-oriented frameworks. Thus, the convergence with HPC requires the development of DevOps-friendly abstractions that abstract away the technical challenges of the use of supercomputers. From a hardware perspective, not only do production-ready chips need to be manufactured, but also a rich software ecosystem needs to be created around such chips to make them useful to developers of AI applications. Finally, compute infrastructures are known to operate at low utilization levels. The update of existing infrastructures with novel management software can yield lower costs both for compute platform operators and AI users.\n",
    "5G networks. Infrastructure sharing in the 5G era across the MNOs will allow unleashing the business potentials for 5G. Infrastructure development and viable operation of 5G networks throughout the country can be accelerated. A 5G ecosystem can be created to promote new applications and innovative solutions for various sectors. As 5G becomes more widely implemented, the government will likely be forced to make policy and operational decisions that can shape the technological future. These decisions can indicate the acceleration of the public sector that will act as a key user of 5G services, in order to offer novel and advanced services to the citizens. Finally, WRC-23 will be an essential opportunity to improve 5G coverage, increase affordability through harmonisation and support growing data demand.\n",
    "4.2 MAIN STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS\n",
    "National AI infrastructures will be developed based on the following strategic directions, which address the development and maintenance of different categories of National AI infrastructures.\n",
    "4.2.1 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 1: PROVIDE A 360 DEGREES VIEW OF NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES - CREATE AN AI INFRASTRUCTURES CATALOGUE\n",
    "To optimize the use of national resources, to identify value-added collaborations across national infrastructure operators and to avoid overlaps, there is a need for having 360 degrees view of the available AI related infrastructures. To this end, a directory integrated under the National Portal for AI (e.g., Greece.ai) will be established, offering a holistic view of available infrastructures, their use, maturity level and development plans. Available AI services for the public sector could also be listed as part of the Gov.gr services catalogue. Moreover, this could benefit from a national standards-based taxonomy of AI systems. AI comprises a wide range of different systems, such as industrial robots, robotic cells, software bots, machine learning systems, NLP systems, automated guided vehicles, and drones. To facilitate procurement and adoption of these systems by industrial enterprises it is recommended that a national taxonomy of AI systems is developed. \n",
    "4.2.2 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 2: INCREASE OPEN DATA AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY\n",
    "The transition to a data economy is a key prerequisite for establishing the national AI ecosystem. To this end, the country will continue and intensify efforts towards open data publishing and developing large national databases, including efforts for linking and fostering interoperability of systems and datasets that are currently siloed. Local and regional authorities should also aim at creating databases and making available open public datasets. In this direction, the development of data portals for cities and regions of the country should be encouraged. The central government (e.g., Hellenic Ministry of the Interior) will try to facilitate the development of open data portals by local governments, through providing guidelines, templates, and best practices for collecting, publishing, and managing data. Datasets of local and regional governments could be aggregated in a single catalogue (e.g., under data.gov.gr). Emphasis should be given on the fact that AI applications typically require high-quality data. This direction will also facilitate the development of AI Reference Projects and building AI Success Stories (see ST5).\n",
    "In addition, companies tend to focus their AI efforts in areas where relevant and appropriate data are already available. They are often interested in using open data to enrich, complement or contextualize their own private datasets, but low-quality open data is often an obstacle in doing so. Therefore, data profiling and quality indicators should be applied to support and facilitate the discovery and assessment of appropriate data assets for AI applications. A part of data.gov.gr could be established as a catalogue of well-structured, high-quality datasets for AI research, development, and innovation. As described later in ST2, such data infrastructures will be important for the research community and should be coupled with other activities focused on improving data accessibility for researchers (see ST2). Furthermore, this could be extended towards a Public - Private data sharing framework (see ST4).\n",
    "An appropriate machine-processable vocabulary should also be developed (probably extending as necessary existing EU efforts such as ADMS and contributing the extension upstream) for annotating datasets regarding their provenance, processing and re-distribution rights, validity period, and quality. Adoption by the Government can drive general adoption, so (a) Government agencies should be required to use this vocabulary to annotate the data assets they provide; (b) Government tenders should require that software procured by the Government processes metadata in this vocabulary where relevant. \n",
    "Finally, data use and re-use should be regulated by appropriate legal requirements and ethical principles, ensuring that it serves the public benefit, financial growth, and societal well-being (see ST6).\n",
    "4.2.3 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 3: CREATE THEMATIC DATA REPOSITORIES\n",
    "In the direction of fostering a data economy, it will be also important to leverage sectorial databases. Hence, in addition to general-purpose open data catalogues (see Strategic Direction 2 above), thematic data repositories should be established in key areas of high interest or importance. These could include: (a) A large-scale, distributed, medical imaging database at national level, through expanding the existing system of GRNET and NHS. This entails the expansion of the system to more hospitals, as well as the development of an infrastructure for sharing the data for medical, research and innovation purposes in-line with applicable laws and regulations.\n",
    "The usage of common standards and cross-organization interoperability for data sharing across Greek healthcare organizations should be encouraged, while employing processes (e.g., anonymization, encryption) that guarantee privacy and protection of sensitive datasets. (b) A large-scale, distributed database of geospatial data, including Earth Observation data and data related to climate change, for enhancing high-value areas for the public and private sectors, such as maritime, agriculture, urban planning, transportation, logistics, etc., as well as contributing to the green transition and the realisation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Such thematic data repositories should also be accessible through the National Portal for AI.\n",
    "4.2.4 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 4: CREATE PLATFORMS FOR INDUSTRIAL DATA MARKETS\n",
    "The establishments of Data Brokers & Data Hubs for specific sectors of the Economy will be considered, in collaboration with the public sector. Data brokers will facilitate the exchange of data across different enterprises. They will act as Trusted Third Parties that manage data contributed by various enterprises within a value chain or a private industrial network. This includes providing a legal framework for the operation and establishment of Data Brokers and incentivizing large enterprises and SMEs to create well-structured, high-quality datasets and to make them available to their partners and collaborators. Industrial data markets should include best practices, guidelines, and tools for data anonymization. Best practices, guidelines and tools for synthetic data generation should also be taken into consideration. A match-making exercise where data providers and consumers declare offers and needs, and some pairs are selected to pilot the concept, using government infrastructure (e.g., GRNET) can help in this direction. Where appropriate, private data could also be combined with open data under a Public - Private data sharing framework (see ST4), e.g., to increase coverage. Data Brokers can also facilitate agreements between the business and research sectors as envisaged in ST2.\n",
    "4.2.5 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 5: SETUP NATIONAL TESTBEDS FOR AI TESTING AND EXPERIMENTATION\n",
    "Establish National Large-Scale Testbeds for supporting and facilitating the development of innovative AI applications (validations, trials, large-scale and small-scale experiments), powered by curated training data, AI algorithms and processing frameworks. Testbeds should provide advanced computing platforms with HPC capabilities and emphasis on the availability of GPUs that will be able to run complex Machine Learning algorithms on massive datasets in a sustainable way. Testbeds should also feature a rich Data Analytics processing stack that will cover the needs of most data processing pipelines, including both Data-in-Motion and Data-at-Rest pipelines. The Universities and Research Centres of the country will be the primary users of these testbeds i.e., they will use them to run innovative data-driven experiments that use AI technologies.\n",
    "Testbeds should become accessible to domain experts, which will boost the applicability and effectiveness of AI different sectors. For instance, manufacturing enterprises must benefit from AI testbeds comprising pilot production lines and laboratories. Also, the agriculture sector must benefit from field testbeds where AI technologies like drones and crop robots could be tested and validated, since the adoption and wider use of AI technologies in agriculture requires considerable investments in infrastructures like sensors, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), GIS (Geographical Information Systems) software, Satellite imagery, and AI enabled cameras. Sector-specific testbeds must become accessible to enterprises, notably to SMEs that lack the resources needed to invest on AI adoption and innovation. They could be established by industrial associations (e.g., SEV) or even as part of private-public partnerships (see ST3 regarding AI Testing and Experimentation Facilities). Furthermore, they should become connected to relevant national infrastructures such as super-computing testbeds, national databases, and Digital Innovation Hubs. In addition, these national testbeds must also be accessible to Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) working on humanities, arts, and social sciences to support the implementation of AI-based projects with high societal and cultural value (see ST6).\n",
    "4.2.6 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 6: EMPOWER CITIZEN-DRIVEN EXPERIMENTS\n",
    "Create the infrastructure for the data equivalent of peer-to-peer microlending, where innovative applications require data and (possibly) manual annotation by potential users. Unlike the testbeds described above, this infrastructure is completely decentralised and \"virtual datasets\" are dynamically created by having individuals contribute (and revoke) access to specific data they personally own and manage. For instance, a mobility innovation could be piloted if thousands of early adopters agree to allow aggregative access to their mobility data, augmented with their own annotations regarding whether each datapoint regards business or leisure-related mobility. Such infrastructure can support and facilitate AI-related citizen science.\n",
    "From a technical point of view, this can be based on initiatives such as Solid (solidproject.org) and MyData (mydata.org) to develop turn-key solutions offered as a service by infrastructure providers. Citizens will use such a service to store personal data and to personally decide on a case-by-case basis where they want to contribute data. Relevant activities should: (a) develop open-source software for both the server side and the client side; (b) subsidise providers who want to host the server-side software to provide low-cost personal pods as a service; and (c) fund calls for projects that will develop and pilot innovative applications.\n",
    "4.2.7 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 7: EMBRACE AND EMPLOY A CLOUD-NATIVE SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY\n",
    "Modern AI operations require both \"data\" (i.e., access to storage) and \"computing\" (i.e., access to processing power) infrastructures that cooperate to extract the necessary results, either on the training or on the inferencing side. Physical locations of data collection/storage and computing infrastructure are separated even between the same organizational boundaries, thus hindering the computation process. This is more evident in the case where an organization requires to expand its resources and utilize, for instance, an external cloud service, without compromising performance and security. Towards this direction, a cloud-native approach based on stateless \"serverless\" microservices that can easily migrate between different physical locations can overcome those obstacles. The public sector can help towards this direction by offering cloud-native execution frameworks through existing infrastructures thus facilitating someone that wishes to take advantage of their functionalities. On the other hand, external stakeholders wishing to harness arbitrary cloud resources can adhere to the modern cloud-native implementation paradigm and take advantage of its opportunities.\n",
    "4.2.8 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 8: EMBRACE OPEN CLOUD STANDARDS DURING ML/AI OPERATIONS\n",
    "Modern AI execution pipelines consist of numerous execution steps that incrementally transform initial data to the final ML/AI product: this process requires different processing libraries and execution engines from both the Machine Learning and the Data Analytics domains that may also be geographically dispersed. The successful execution of such diverse pipelines in Cloud Infrastructures relies on the adoption of open (i.e., non-proprietary, well documented) standards during both the development and deployment towards an open MLOps strategy. An open MLOps approach will minimize vendor-lock-in scenarios which may arise when a specific implementation is selected. This will enable the relative stakeholders to consider a wider set of possible cloud providers. \n",
    "4.2.9 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 9: MAINTAIN, UPGRADE AND IMPROVE SUPERCOMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURES FOR AI\n",
    "Leading edge AI applications such as deep learning are extremely data and computationally intensive. Therefore, the development of large-scale AI applications requires access to supercomputing resources. Such resources will be made freely available to the research and scientific community of the country, as also stressed out in ST2. Moreover, taking into account that AI applications require heterogeneous hardware for improved performance, such as GPUs, TPUs, etc., existing infrastructures need to upgrade their resources towards this direction in the upcoming infrastructure procurement opportunities. The availability of GPUs and TPUs is of extreme importance for supporting AI research and experimentation. Private sector enterprises should be supported as much as possible in getting access to the amount of computational and storage resources that might be needed for building innovative AI products and services. Appropriate pricing models can be utilized to democratize and regulate the utilization of resources (e.g., a reverse-wholesale scheme, where the more time units an entity buys, the more expensive they become, thus offering a financial incentive to move out of the innovation-driving infrastructure and towards a general-purpose commercial infrastructure as soon as utilization grows beyond some point). To support such needs, GRNET's ARIS supercomputing infrastructure should be maintained and upgraded, considering needs for AI application development. ML infrastructures (e.g., Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow) should be provided over the supercomputers to allow efficient and scalable ML model training. This also includes computing and storage requirements for different types of applications ranging from small-scale deployments to grand challenges. In parallel, existing connections with EU-wide infrastructures such as EuroHPC, PRACE, the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and EU's Artificial Intelligence on Demand (AI4U) platform will be strengthened.\n",
    "4.2.10 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 10: GREEN AI INFRASTRUCTURES\n",
    "Audit and minimize the carbon footprint of AI infrastructures and develop green data centres. AI infrastructures should be environmentally friendly and energy efficient. In this direction, the development of Green Data Centres will be encouraged and pursued whenever possible. Relevant specifications should be included in tenders and public procurement documents. European best practices and regulations should be considered. Furthermore, the environmental footprint of AI infrastructures should be regularly audited in terms of their compliance to standards like CENELEC EN 5060025. These activities will complement and enhance the sustainability activities foreseen under ST6, leading to additional benefits about the improvement of environment performance and sustainability of the National AI Ecosystem.\n",
    "Green Data Centres will provide a sound basis for minimizing carbon footprint of AI applications that leverage cloud resources. Recently, Green AI approaches are also developed as part of the edge and far-edge computing paradigm. For example, TinyML and embedded machine learning technologies enable the execution of AI on microcontrollers, which are much more power efficient than data centres and other computing devices (e.g., smart phones). Whenever applicable such approaches should be encouraged by setting CO2 reduction and other green KPIs in public sector projects and specifications. \n",
    "4.2.11 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 11: OPTIMAL USE OF THE SPECTRUM AND CREATION OF DEVELOPERS COMMUNITY FOR 5G-DRIVEN APPLICATIONS, EXPLOITING THE 5G-CORE NATIVE APIS\n",
    "The development of 5G needs a significant amount of new harmonised mobile spectrum so defragmenting and clearing prime bands should be prioritised. The need to identify more spectrum below 1 GHz has to be met in order to spread the benefits of 5G to rural areas and accelerate Internet of Things (IoT) growth. Moreover, spectrum in the 6 and 10 GHz ranges is required to enhance 5G connectivity. Voluntary spectrum sharing approaches are preferable to set asides as they can be used to support all potential 5G users, including verticals. For example, MNOs can be permitted to lease their spectrum assets so that verticals can build their own private 5G networks. On the other hand, in order to justify widespread heavy network investments and support 5G services that will enhance AI, mobile operators need assured access to significant amounts of licensed spectrum for a sufficient duration (e.g., 20 year licences).\n",
    "AI and 5G represent a symbiotic combination and enable each other. To achieve ultra-low latency and meet the requirements of AI based use cases such as, self-driving autonomous vehicles, automating or managing public transportation, time critical industry automation, remote healthcare, operators need to be able to provide computing resources across the whole telco domain - all the way to the edge of the mobile network. Service exposure and APIs will play a key role in creating solutions that are both effective and cost efficient.  All in all, MNOs should understand that 5G applications and use cases need to be better identified, therefore targeting specific industries should be a crucial aspect of their strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. STRATEGIC TARGET 2 (ST2): AI RESEARCH, EDUCATION & SKILLS CAPITAL\n",
    "5.1 CURRENT STATUS - CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES\n",
    "This Strategic target is organised along three distinct yet interrelated areas of focus: Research, Education, and Skills development. Given the broadness and salience of all three areas, we have delved into each topic individually and organised the Chapter along three complementary but clearly defined directions. A cross-cutting theme that traverses all three sub-targets concerns talent retention, development, and attraction, which is addressed within several actions via case-appropriate measures (e.g., under actions focusing on educational reforms, attraction of talented researchers etc). Work across the above-listed focus areas aim at creating a climate that encourages and supports knowledge enhancement, upskilling, and research excellence, in order to equip Greece with citizens, workers, and leaders who are adept to the AI challenges of the 21st century.  \n",
    "5.1.1 SHORTCOMINGS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN RESEARCH \n",
    "Looking at the Greek research landscape, a series of surveys conducted by the Hellenic Artificial Intelligence Society about recent activities in several subfields of AI, reveal a number of prominent efforts and results that span over a wide variety of topics, covering both fundamental topics of AI as well as application areas. With respect to the former, there are several renowned research teams working on machine learning and data mining, uncertainty in AI, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, multi-agent and agent-based systems, constraint satisfaction, planning and scheduling, and knowledge representation and reasoning [Koubarakis18]. The AI community in Greece is also active in developing a wide range of applications covering areas such as Entertainment, Business, Commerce, Finance, e-Government, Health and Biomedicine, Education, Engineering, Industry, Telecommunications, Web, Pervasive Systems, in conjunction to other applications for specific problems in numerous domains [EETN]. \n",
    "Despite promising efforts and accomplishments, the potential of the Greek AI research ecosystem is hampered by several inhibiting factors. First and foremost, it must cope with difficulties in retaining and attracting talented researchers, aggravated by the well-known problem of brain drain. A series of actions that invest in human capital (\"Rebrain Greece\") should be taken with the aim to limit researcher attrition, increase brain gain, and ultimately create a critical mass of talented junior and senior researchers as well as eminent research projects in relevant key areas of AI. It is important that the respective actions are informed and aligned with ongoing developments at the European level, e.g., take into account priority areas set forth by upcoming research calls, such as Trustworthy AI, Greener AI, Sparking the edge-to-cloud AI Revolution, Next generation of Smart Robotics, and other related domains. Good practices for retaining, attracting, and retaining talent should be adopted, e.g., see [EURegions18], considering the Greek circumstances. \n",
    "Greece lacks a fully functioning, harmonized AI ecosystem that can establish the foundation for boosting value created by the development and deployment of AI technologies. No single player can achieve this alone; the sharing of assets, technology, skills, and knowledge is crucial. Joint R&D can help strengthen AI cooperation across research organisations with shared goals and values and pool resources and expertise to enable greater research impact and larger scale research on topics of importance. Coordination can also help identify duplicative research that should be turned into joint efforts.\n",
    "It is important that actions focused on supporting research activities are coupled with appropriate measures that ensure that the Greek educational system produces enough talented AI researchers. A relevant and cost-efficient method to make Greece competitive in the international AI research ecosystem is to invest in multidisciplinary. As a matter of fact, AI is a research topic that has a lot to gain from cross-fertilisation with fields outside Computer Science. For example, mathematicians and statisticians can provide new insights with regards to fundamental AI problems, whereas biochemists, biologists and other disciplines can provide interesting research problems and application domains that will fuel AI research. On the other hand, social studies and other disciplines such as philosophy and ethics can contribute to a humane, trustworthy and acceptable AI, aligned to current (and future) values, also studying the interaction between AI and societal dimensions.\n",
    "As affirmed by a series of studies (see for example [EETN], [Accenture19], [BCG20]) the Greek industry is not significantly involved in the developing and/or exploitation of AI applications. As a result, many attempts to build intelligent systems stop at the production of prototypes rather than commercial products. Therefore, it is important to place emphasis on actions towards reinforcing lab-to-the-market initiatives, which incentivize collaborations with the industry and boost uptake of research by businesses. Guidelines aiming at bridging the gap between research and industry for the mutual benefit of both sectors are covered under ST3. \n",
    "Another key enabler to getting the most out of AI is having a \"data-friendly ecosystem with unified standards and cross-platform sharing\". AI depends on data that can be analysed in real time and brought to bear on concrete problems. According to a McKinsey Global Institute study, nations that promote open data sources and data sharing are the ones most likely to see AI advances [McKinsey17]. In general, the research community needs better access to government and business data, although with appropriate safeguards to make sure researchers do not misuse data. Data sharing should be complemented with affordable access to computational power and storage capacity. It is also essential to ease access to a modern infrastructure that offers researchers maximum performance for high-performance simulation, data processing and analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, enabling them to overcome current limitations, explore new applications, tackle forthcoming challenges in science and advance the competitiveness of research and innovation in Greece. In this respect, the participation of Greek stakeholders in ongoing EU-level initiatives, such as in the EuroCC European network of 33 National HPC Competence Centres and the European supercomputer Leonardo managed by the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking should be supported and extended, to ensure that Greece's computing infrastructures are upscaled and catch-up the latest developments in the field. \n",
    "5.1.2 SHORTCOMINGS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN EDUCATION\n",
    "As AI applications accelerate across many sectors, it is vital that we reimagine our educational institutions for a world where AI will be ubiquitous, and students need a different kind of training than they currently receive. Despite some first steps which have been taken both at the primary-secondary as well as tertiary level, many students still do not receive instruction in the kinds of skills that are needed in an AI-dominated landscape.\n",
    "Many Greek men and women choose to pursue tertiary studies in STEM-related subjects, including AI. According to data published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Greece ranks sixth in the world with respect to its number of STEM graduates (based on information gathered in 2012). An interesting insight concerns the fact that Greece is the second country, behind Italy, regarding the number of women who chose natural sciences and engineering for their post-secondary education, with 44% percent of individuals studying in these fields being women. \n",
    "According to an ongoing data collection from the Hellenic AI Society (EETN - www.eetn.gr), more than 150 total AI-related courses are offered in BSc or BSc-integrated-MSc (5-year) programmes of at least 21 universities. A variety of topics are covered, ranging from artificial intelligence and robotics, to pattern recognition, computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning (and deep learning) and data mining. Courses also include big data aspects, as well as topics on the Internet of Things and the Semantic Web. At the MSc level, approximately 50 MSc. programmes offer a total of over 160 AI-related modules. These modules provide deeper understanding of AI topics, including specific application domains (space, energy, geographical information systems, bio-medical informatics, networks, business intelligence etc.) and other multidisciplinary research topics (e.g., intelligent management of data from the Humanities, cyber-physical systems, human-computer interaction). Moreover, an agreement between the Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs and the country's tertiary institutions is under way about the organisation of courses covering technical developments in AI and market applications. \n",
    "Despite the high interest by young people to major in STEM and the increasing offer of AI-relevant undergraduate courses and MSc programmes, demand for graduates with competent skills in AI fundamentals and applications (including data scientists, computer scientists, engineers, coders, and platform developers) in the marketplace remains unmet. At the same time, students who major in disciplines beyond computer science lack the necessary knowledge and skills to take advantage of AI developments in their domain of specialisation. Appropriate initiatives have to be introduced in the educational system at all levels in order to bridge the gap between offer and supply of people with such capabilities. \n",
    "Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) have also an important role to play with respect to raising awareness about AI concepts, promises, and risks among the broader public. Open actions organised by HEIs and research centres, such as the well-attended Researcher's Night initiatives, aimed at bringing the public - and especially young people- into contact with research developments and to stimulate interest in STEM careers need to be scaled up. Special attention should be paid to building links with primary and secondary schools, so as to engage pupils and, notably, those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in, STEM or research activities. Note also that the Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) of universities need to be activated to connect academia with private and public sector AI digital transformation and entrepreneurship. \n",
    "In primary and secondary education, enabling students to develop knowledge about AI and computational thinking in general has less to do with the use of high-tech digital tools in the classroom and more with the design of appropriate school curricula and the way STEM is integrated in existing subjects taught at schools of all levels. In a typical Greek classroom, epistemic and scientific concepts remain at large disconnected from experiential learning and experimentation, while applied and technological modules, such as ICT, do not keep up with evolutions in the technological state of the art. This situation is reaffirmed by the status of OER repositories (e.g., photodentro, ebooks) addressed to educators, which include very limited if any resources related to AI. Actually, most existing STEM-related applied tools and practices are limited to material addressed to EPAL educators and students. \n",
    "One of the main objectives of the Greek Digital Strategy (i.e., Objective 3) is the upskilling of Greek pupils and educators with respect to digital competences. So far, recent initiatives taken in primary and secondary education, such as the \"Digital School Strategy\", the EduLabs, and the Skills Labs for educators, have primarily focused on the digital upgrade of Greek schools, via equipping schools with ICT devices (e.g., installation of interactive systems, laptops) and via training courses for teachers on the application of digital tools. Although these are some first steps towards improving digital competences of both teachers and pupils, a more holistic and radical reform that goes beyond the use of ICT tools is required towards creating better prepared graduates who can compete globally.\n",
    "Finally, it should be noted that the Greek public education system is considered a strength of the country when it comes to boosting access to technology such as AI.\n",
    "5.1.3 SHORTCOMINGS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN SKILLS CAPITAL\n",
    "With the acceleration of AI expansion across most sectors of the private and public economy, the required skills of public and private employees have not necessarily been updated, respectively. Also, even though: (a) STEM-related education is among the first choices of Greek students (b) during the last years around 50 MSc programs offer AI-related courses and (c) more than 150 AI-courses are offered by Greek BSc programs, there is still a huge need for updating the existing workforce of both the public and the private sector, as well as the broader public, with practical and theoretical skills related to AI and ML. Specifically, it is important to develop employee skills, with respect to both the technical and the business fronts [Koumbarakis18]: technical skills are crucial for people who develop the AI solutions, while digital savviness is crucial for the businesspeople who identify the use cases and support their development.\n",
    "The existing workforce in the public and private sector (even the employees with a STEM major), in many cases have been out of the higher educational system since the time when AI and ML courses at BSc or MSc were not so frequent. Even those with sufficient theoretical ML and AI skills achieved through a BSc or MSc program, usually lack the practical knowledge necessary in the industry, especially those that have worked for several years in other CS positions not requiring AI skills (frontend developers, backend developers, software engineers, data engineers, etc)\n",
    "Most major Greek companies, SMEs and start-ups have started involving procedures and products that are based on AI methodologies. In many cases, (especially in the cases of start-ups) AI and ML is a core element of the product offering. This continuously increasing and horizontal demand for AI expertise and understanding in both research-level and product-level is naturally left unmet and is usually covered with self-taught and non-expert schemes. In simple words, \"career shifts\" such as: software developers to \"AI/ML engineers\", database engineers to \"data scientists\" or even non-technical employees to \"business intelligence\" are usually performed through a quick bootcamp or a short online seminary or even hands-on internal knowledge, without always following an organized onboarding process.  \n",
    "On the other hand, highly qualified research and academic staff of Greek Universities and Research Centers, have gained enormous experience and international scientific validity in the sector of AI and to its applications such as: computer vision, multimodal data processing, audio and speech processing, natural language understanding, etc.  Despite this potential, there is still a gap between the research and the business aspects of AI, especially when it comes to communicating AI methodologies and deploying AI solutions in real-world products and services, but also in non-business applications.\n",
    "For the aforementioned reasons, there is a need for a better combination of business and technical skills. Most organizations, regardless of their scale (large corporates to start-ups) have not fully realized the full potential and challenges of AI, creating an explicit need for an organized upskilling of the public and private sector employees, the executives and even the broader public, towards making the capabilities and intricacies of AI an inherent component of their work and life.   \n",
    "5.2 MAIN STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS\n",
    "5.2.1 DIRECTIONS FOR AI RESEARCH\n",
    "5.2.1.1 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 1. EQUIP THE AI RESEARCH ECOSYSTEM WITH TALENTED RESEARCHERS THROUGH INVESTING IN HUMAN CAPITAL\n",
    "Existing funding instruments, such as the Hellenic Foundation on Research and Innovation (HFRI), should be leveraged to provide funding to young researchers (PhDs, postdocs) to work on AI-related fields. This could be done, e.g., by appropriate calls for proposals, specifically aimed at young researchers. Moreover, appropriate incentives for young researchers should be provided, including monetary incentives (salaries) and opportunities for career development, which are important to stimulate talented people to work within the Greek research community after they finish their graduate and postgraduate studies. For example, decisions limiting post-doctoral researcher salaries, especially when compared to the industry in Greece and abroad, constitute counterincentives and should be revisited.\n",
    "Junior researchers are critical for excellence, but not sufficient to guarantee a competitive AI research ecosystem. On the other side of the spectrum, senior researchers with a strong track record should also be supported to set up competent teams (e.g., via senior fellowships, creation of tenured staff positions) and act as attraction poles and inspiration for young researchers working on AI.\n",
    "Moreover, given the large Greek human capital abroad, incentives should be provided for the repatriation of Greek scientists living (and working) abroad, by improving Greece's appeal to foreign talent. To achieve this, a critical mass of attractive positions, projects, and centres of excellence, grounded on transparent selection criteria of eminence should be created. Stimuli for retaining and attracting talent should consider the offering of both tangible and intangible perks (e.g., by allocating an attractive ratio between research-oriented and educational or administrative tasks) as well as the mitigation of structural impediments. Offering growth opportunities, improving working conditions, providing internationally competitive salaries, and reducing hurdles associated with the unpredictability of the operational environment and appointment procedures, are some measures that can significantly increase the \"brain-gain\" phenomenon and counterbalance the inevitable brain drain. \n",
    "Given the fast development of the AI field, it is also important to keep up with developments and be agile in adapting to changes in the AI research environment. Towards this aim, it is important to set up an Expert Group that will follow developments on the field, continuously assess the country's needs and strengths, and adapt the above suggestions accordingly, e.g., by proposing areas in which more focus on attracting talents should be placed.\n",
    "5.2.1.2 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 2: SUPPORT EXISTING AND NEW RESEARCH INITIATIVES ON AI, ENSURING A BALANCE BETWEEN FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED RESEARCH\n",
    "Public programmes and calls for AI-related projects should be set up with the aim to: (i) increase investment in projects in AI fundamental research; and (ii) direct funding on AI applications that are expected to bring a high economic and social impact. HFRI's role should be leveraged in this respect.\n",
    "A series of challenging AI areas to which funding should be directed has to be defined.  AI projects can be supported via individual fellowships and especially through the funding of projects led by consortia of stakeholders. In the latter case, special emphasis should be placed on basic and applied research that couples AI with other dimensions, such as Data Science, Robotics, Cloud Computing, Natural Language Processing (NLP) etc, through projects driven by small consortia that comprise at least 2 academic/research partners. Topics that are recognized as high priority for Europe in the years to come, such as Greener AI, Trustworthy AI, edge-to-cloud AI, Smart Robotics, Federated Machine Learning, Human-AI Augmentation/Collaboration, Privacy-Preserving AI, Unifying Symbolic and Deep learning approaches, and TinyML should also be prioritised. Moreover, AI for Space is an important area which has received a lot of attention in Europe recently through programs on Earth Observation (e.g., Copernicus), where Greek organizations participate with active roles.  Furthermore, research on AI applications that involve IoT and sensor data should be emphasized as well, given that the Greek research community has proven expertise and international track record in IoT applications. Also, research on AI for media applications should be pursued, as Greek organizations have leading roles in prominent European initiatives (e.g., CERTH is the coordinator of the flagship AI4Media project), while the topic is important for supporting free and independent media in-line with overall goal of democratic AI. In the years to come significant research opportunities in these areas are likely to emerge. Greece should be prepared to address these emerging AI areas and to pursue relevant opportunities for excellent research and attraction of funding. The implementation of research projects will be defined in a \"push\" way by national funding authorities. This \"push\" modality can prioritize projects in the above-listed areas. Nevertheless, a \"pull\" modality will be also pursued based on calls for research projects, where Research and Technology organizations will be invited to propose AI projects. \n",
    "At the same time, funding should also be directed to synergies that exhibit uptake of AI by social sciences, humanities, and social innovation initiative, that may not draw upon conventional short-term Return on Investment measurements but have a multi-dimensional social impact and contribute to improving conditions for innovation that goes beyond financial value creation. In this context, there is great potential in multidisciplinary synergies that explore the potential of AI and ICT in the cultural heritage sector and history studies but also in collaborations between the research community with civic society organisations that aim to mitigate society's pressing problems (see also the strategic directions towards a more inclusive AI in ST6).\n",
    "Moreover, AI research findings can find applications in public administration. The Ministry of Digital Transformation could consider defining specific AI-related problems that could support the functioning of the public administration (e.g., algorithms for spotting financial crimes such as tax evasion or money laundering) and outsourcing them through competitive calls for proposals to Greek companies or research institutes, e.g., using the HFRI instrument. This would encourage research on AI, to support the development of solutions for such problems.\n",
    "5.2.1.3 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 3: PROMOTE COLLABORATIONS ACROSS RESEARCH CENTRES AND UNIVERSITIES AT AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL\n",
    "Research on AI requires access to a significant amount of computational resources, large datasets and multi-faceted data. This encourages collaborations and makes AI one of the fields where collaborative work creates an additive effect. This fact, combined with the recent hype associated with AI, has spawned a significant number of initiatives in Europe and elsewhere, which aim at supporting collaborative AI research, by establishing partnerships between research stakeholders in the field across different countries and fostering the AI research community be developing standards, common repositories for data, methodologies and even code. Such initiatives include organisations such as the CLAIRE (and the CLAIRE International Advisory Board) and ELLIS, and projects (EU Networks of Excellence) such as AI4EU, TAILOR, HumanAI, ELLIS/ELISE and AI4Media. Greek academic and industrial partners should be encouraged to participate in such initiatives and have a say in the formulation of future initiatives related to AI. The Greek state should also be involved through some appropriate scheme. As a first step, an inventory of relevant EU-level and international initiatives and of respective roles of Greek stakeholders in existing partnerships should be created. Greece's international research partnerships will be also exploited towards linking the resources of the National AI Marketplace (e.g., datasets, AI models and pipelines, AI solutions) to other EU-level marketplaces.\n",
    "Moreover, collaborations with foreign AI research stakeholders should be supported by setting-up mobility programs for experts and by strengthening collaborations with AI researchers of the Greek diaspora (e.g., via R&D or Technology Transfer programs).\n",
    "5.2.1.4 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 4: BOOST THE COLLABORATION OF ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND RESEARCH CENTRES ON AI - ESTABLISH A CONFEDERATION OF UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH CENTRES TO COORDINATE ACTIVITIES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL\n",
    "A body that oversees and coordinates research activities in different AI areas conducted across different laboratories in Greece can highly contribute towards pooling resources and expertise to enable greater research impact and joining efforts towards larger scale and more efficient research in topics of importance. The coordination can be grounded in a series of agreements between different universities, research centres and other partners active in basic or applied AI research or even take the form of a new separate legal entity. \n",
    "Partnerships between different bodies active in AI research can take many forms. Some examples include Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), Collaborative Research Alliances (CRAs), Collaborative Technical Alliances (CTAs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs). The following table summarizes the agreement mechanisms available, which are categorized thematically as follows:\n",
    " Research partnership agreements. These agreements provide for joint and collaborative research.\n",
    " Resource-use agreements. These agreements allow partners to use laboratory equipment offered by other partners for testing and evaluation.\n",
    " Personnel exchange agreements. These agreements support mobility across different organisations and enable researchers (usually those more advanced in their careers) from one organization to be employed temporarily or indefinitely by another organization.\n",
    " Educational agreements. These agreements offer opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and professors to extend their education and research experience and for universities to co-develop educational initiatives with Federal laboratories.\n",
    " Other types of agreements. Agreements with actors from the public and private sector or who are interested in setting up research.\n",
    "5.2.1.5 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 5. IMPROVING KNOWLEDGE SHARING AND DATA ACCESS FOR THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY \n",
    "As already outlined in ST1 directives for fostering a data economy, the Greek government will pay attention to the provision of a well-functioning data infrastructure. Existing open data portals will be upgraded, especially with respect to the quality of the offered databases and the alignment with unified standards, so as to promote accessibility to data of public administrations. An appropriate infrastructure which provides data, software and high-performance computing services required for AI R&D should be developed and offered to the Greek research community. .\n",
    "Concerning accessibility to proprietary data, bridges between researchers and companies will be developed to encourage sharing of data while paying attention to consumer protection. For example, one way could be through voluntary agreements with companies holding proprietary data. Entities playing the role of Data Brokers as described in ST1 could have a role in orchestrating such agreements.\n",
    "Open Access to scientific results is also a key tool for promoting AI research, improving the quality of research and the free dissemination of knowledge in society. To promote the open AI science policy, efforts will be made towards the establishment of an \"Open\" AI national network that involves Greek stakeholders in discussions around Open Science, building on the insights provided in the proposal for a National Open Science Strategy drafted by a team of research centres, universities and other stakeholders [AAG2020]. In doing so, a set of landscaping activities and surveys should take place, so as to get a better understanding of the Greek AI research ecosystem, identify and realise the challenges behind technical, ethical and cultural aspects in choosing Open Access, and reflecting perceptions of diverse national stakeholders. Some of the activities can be performed with and for the General Secretariat of Research and Technology (GSRT) in the context of the working group on Open Science that has established with the ATHENA R.C., which already acts as the National Open Access Desk (NOAD) for Greece. Greek OpenAIRE NOAD can facilitate those processes for literature and data repositories to become compliant with Article 29.2 of the H2020 grant agreement and enhance their visibility both nationally and in the EU. The Greek OpenAIRE NOAD in collaboration with academic and research organisations will intensify its efforts to spread awareness through a number of activities: webinars in Greek language to inform about trends in OA to AI related publications, research data, to update on EU requirements and the EOSC, etc. workshops targeting all stakeholders to discuss and work together on pre-defined issues training events in issues around Open Science (e.g. data management plans) and in using specific OpenAIRE services and tools (e.g. Amnesia).\n",
    "5.2.2 DIRECTIONS FOR AI IN EDUCATION\n",
    "5.2.2.1 HIGHER EDUCATION\n",
    "5.2.2.1.1 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 1. ENHANCE MULTIDISCIPLINARY UNDER- AND POSTGRADUATE COURSES AND PROGRAMMES ON AI-RELATED SUBJECTS, INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMMES \n",
    "Tertiary institutions should offer more courses and postgraduate programmes on data science and AI methods as well as aim to increase the number of accepted students at existing AI postgraduate programmes. Such programmes should also target students from disciplines beyond natural sciences and technology, from humanities and health to finance and agriculture. To this end, existing initiatives must be broadened towards an interdisciplinary direction, through the collaboration between Computer Science (CS) departments and departments from the humanities, health, environmental, engineering, and other disciplines. \n",
    "The main aim should be that students from all disciplines learn how they can take advantage of AI technologies and methods to facilitate tasks and solve problems in their sector of expertise and become aware of the ethical concerns and other complexities involved. \n",
    "This aim can be achieved by (i) introducing more courses on AI and data science in BSc degrees of non-CS departments and (ii) organising general-purpose MSc programmes on AI fundamentals targeting students across disciplines as well sector-specific specialisations on AI applications. Coordination between the various programmes must be sought towards minimizing overlaps and maximizing value for money. Emphasis should be laid on courses that equip students with knowledge and skills that can prove helpful in domains where Greece has a competitive advantage and are expected to produce a high economic and societal impact, such as maritime transport, tourism and cultural heritage, health, and legal sectors. Agreements between the Education Ministry and the country's tertiary institutions can be established towards this direction. \n",
    "Dedicated efforts towards the creation of programmes on AI taught in English should be made, with the aim to attract international students.\n",
    "Beyond degree programs and certificates, more specific incentives, and motivation to engage in AI activities and to acquire AI education will be provided. For example, a national distinction of \"AI expert or Fellow\" when completing a series of relevant studies will be considered.\n",
    "5.2.2.1.2 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 2. STRENGTHEN INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES AND LINKS WITH AI RESEARCH AS PART OF UNIVERSITY CURRICULA\n",
    "Links between tertiary education and research on AI should be strengthened, mainly by associating relevant BSc and diploma theses with ongoing research conducted by academics and by building collaborations between universities and research centres in this context. In tandem with involving students in research-oriented activities, another equally salient objective concerns the reinforcement of internship programmes for students on projects that utilize AI methods in commercial technology development and applications. Universities must encourage students to take up internships and engage in global internships programmes. More collaborations and agreements with local businesses which can offer training opportunities for students in AI-related subjects should be established, e.g. in the framework of BSc/diploma theses or as part of dedicated traineeship programmes that are part of universities curricula. Moreover, industrial PhDs to be carried out in a collaboration that involves a private or public sector company and a university should be reinforced.\n",
    "5.2.2.1.3 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 3: ESTABLISH COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AND PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOLS TO BRING PUPILS IN CONTACT WITH LATEST ADVANCES IN AI\n",
    "A coordinated approach regarding initiatives that open up universities and research centres to pupils attending primary and secondary schools must be adopted, so as to reinforce interest of pupils in AI and STEM and inform their career choices. Emphasis must be put on reinforcing the interest and inclusion of girls/women in AI and STEM. A centralised inventory of existing and planned initiatives (e.g., visits to university labs, demonstration sessions of research achievements, courses addressed to pupils etc) should be created as part of the National AI Portal/Marketplace and a nationwide programme for the participation of schools in such events should be organised. Moreover, universities should contribute with the delivery of educational material on science and technology that can be used by educators, pupils, their families, and the broader public. \n",
    "5.2.2.1.4 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 4: ORGANISE CITIZEN SCIENCE INITIATIVES TO INVOLVE THE BROADER PUBLIC IN ONGOING AI RESEARCH PROJECTS \n",
    "The organisation of Citizen Science initiatives by HEIs in collaboration with public organisations and research institutions can highly contribute towards broadening knowledge on the potential and impact of AI. Citizen Science is a form of crowdsourcing that allows participants to become directly involved in the scientific process through data collection and other direct contributions to research for the mutual benefit of the scientific community and participants. Citizen science projects can bring unique benefits, including accelerating scientific research (e.g. by providing annotating datasets, observations etc), providing hands-on learning on state-of-the-art scientific developments, increasing STEM literacy, and addressing societal needs. The establishment of a Citizen Science Authority (which can get inspiration from the US-based Federal Community of Practice for Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science6) will be considered across departments and disciplines to coordinate and support actions in the field (e.g., help organise and document initiatives for citizen engagement, organise citizen prize competitions). Participation of Greek organisations in ongoing EU-level initiatives such as the European Citizen Science Association should be promoted as well. Citizen science initiatives must be coordinated with actions aimed towards democratisation of science and AI at large under ST6. Moreover, these initiatives can benefit from the infrastructure for citizen-provided data described in ST1, but also from awareness events outlined in ST3.\n",
    "5.2.2.2 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION\n",
    "5.2.2.2.1 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 1. STRENGTHEN STEM EDUCATION IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION CURRICULA. \n",
    "Educators and pupils' digital skills must be improved towards a more holistic approach to STEM education. Necessary reforms should be introduced with the aim to combine science, technology, engineering and mathematics into a cohesive curriculum that balances between epistemological knowledge with real-world problem-solving.  For example, a committee should be formed and assigned with the task to propose concrete actions towards an integrated STEM approach in Greek primary and secondary education, including EPAL (Vocational Senior High Schools). The goal will be to incorporate into schools best teaching and learning practices and concepts for the operative delivery of STEM interdisciplinary didactic models. STEM-oriented educational approaches followed in other countries will be adopted and adjusted taking into account the constraints and characteristics of the Greek reality. \n",
    "Digital literacy and engineering competency should be pursued in a more general and systematic interdisciplinary context that fosters discovery and experiential learning. In this respect, the focus of ICT-related subjects must be less about teaching the use of technological artifacts and more about exercising algorithmic knowledge and connecting concepts from mathematics, physics etc to engineering design and experimentation in a practical setting. All pupils, independently of whether they will major in STEM or not, should be able to recognize how AI and digital technologies influence people and systems as well as understand that they can be useful and relevant in different sectors, from humanities to health and the environment. Discussion about ethical aspects of AI should also become part of schools' curricula. \n",
    "5.2.2.2 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 2: TRAIN EDUCATORS ON STEM SUBJECTS AND PEDAGOGICAL APPROACHES, SUPPORT THEM TO APPLY GOOD PRACTICES, AND EQUIP SCHOOLS.\n",
    "A prerequisite for a successful STEM approach is the appropriate training and support of educators in gaining appropriate content knowledge in STEM subjects as well as instructional practices and pedagogical strategies they can integrate in the modules they teach. Training programmes addressed to educators should be organised on topics such as: strengthening their knowledge on STEM subjects; incorporating innovative STEM pedagogical methods into teaching approaches; reusing available open resources; AI concepts and methods that can be incorporated and discussed in the context of current modules, both from the ethical-philosophical perspectives and the scientific/technological one. Introducing incentives for educators to expand their skills via training and to integrate innovative pedagogical practices to the traditional teaching routine and organise respective initiatives (such as experiments, team projects implementation, attend visits and programmes organised in collaboration with researchers and innovators etc) would expedite the reform process. A monitoring mechanism for overseeing and recording the concrete ways in which schools' uptake and implement STEM initiatives would also be helpful. This could be initially done via pilot actions, targeting specific schools. In the longer term, initial teachers' education must be aligned accordingly.\n",
    "Pilot actions for the establishment and equipment of science, engineering and technology labs at schools should be expanded, with the aim to reinforce project-based learning processes and act as a space for experimentation, discovery, and teamwork. Moreover, open Educational Resources repositories for educators should be improved and enriched with practical methods, examples, tools, and reading material related to AI and STEM in general, especially with respect to approaches that can be readily incorporated by educators in existing modules. An effort towards translating available MOOC and other material that supports good practices from around the world would contribute to this direction in coordination with broader activities aiming to the up-skilling of Greece's workforce as part of the directions outlined in following paragraphs.\n",
    "Emphasis will be also paid on educators that can provide interdisciplinary education (e.g., law and technology, economics, and technology). Knowledge on most than one disciplines are fundamental in helping AI experts create data marketplaces and applications, yet there are very few lawyers and economists that understand the technology enough to promote solutions. \n",
    "5.2.3 SKILLS CAPITAL\n",
    "5.2.3.1 STRATEGIC DIRECTION. PUBLIC UPSKILLING CAMPAIGNS FOR AWARENESS, TRUST AND DEMOCRATISATION OF AI\n",
    "It is imperative to increase public awareness with regards to what AI is about, aiming to gain trust and increase activism related to AI democratisation and use. To this end, a public upskilling campaigns must be carried out. They will aim to introduce AI at different levels and build the related skills capital. A multi-disciplinary approach to ascertain a holistic view of AI is suggested, towards co-creation of more applicable, more mature, and more acceptable AI technologies, products, and practices. Public upskilling should be considered under a new institutional establishment, like the National AI Literacy Project proposed in ST6 as part of the National Digital Academy. \n",
    "Different groups must be addressed, indicatively as follows:\n",
    " Students and their parents, opening access to existing Greek online courses on AI and ML for both children and adults. This target group could also be approached through sub-actions such as AI Olympiad participation, learning vouchers and other support measures.\n",
    " Non tech-savvy population: development of reference popularised AI courses that are freely available to citizens. The courses should discuss shortcomings, trade-offs and ethical issues as well as educate citizens on their rights and ways to actively participate in the active dialogue about ethical, trustworthy, and democratic AI. A wide range of different application domains should be covered (e.g., health, legal, health, financial/banking, tourism, agriculture, energy and logistics among others).\n",
    " The elderly population, so as to build trust with regards to AI automations, especially for home monitoring systems (cf. SHAPES EU project deliverables for suggestions). For instance, one can enhance existing municipal training sessions for older populations with AI-awareness courses.\n",
    " People with accessibility challenges (cf. EU and National accessibility guidelines) and their careers.\n",
    "5.2.3.2 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 2: AI-TRAINING FOR PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES AND DECISION MAKERS\n",
    "AI, ML and data analytics - related skills in Public Administration are becoming more and more necessary, while at the same time requiring continuous improvement. In addition, the need to develop and provide e-services to citizens and businesses increases the demand for executives with a higher level of skills related to AI services offered by the Public Sector in the future. Hence, there is a need for actions that upskill public sector employees and decision makers, create a first set of innovators in the sector, and create momentum related to the human-centric adoption of AI. Relevant activities should be planned and performed in close synergies with responsible/relevant stakeholders of the public sector (e.g., National Centre for Public Administration). Overall, the projects to be planned in this direction should aim at:\n",
    " Equip the public servants with the skills needed to understand and use AI systems and methodologies. Create or (re)use online material on AI and incentivise employee certification on this material. In this direction, interdisciplinary education activities (e.g., combining law and AI for the Ministry of Justice or AI and Finance for the Ministry of Finance) should be planned as well.\n",
    " Establish cooperation with the Ministry of Interior Affairs and with EKDDA, as a strategic training body for civil servants and employees of the Local Authorities, as well as with other respective educational institutions in the public and private sector. Through this cooperation, the education and training of public sector employees and executives is sought to be in line with the planned National Digital Skills Framework, which will be harmonized with the respective European Digital Capacity Framework (DigComp) system in conjunction with the DigComputer system. These collaborations will lead to a common framework of cooperation, defining the type and form of planning and implementation of training actions for almost all civil servants and employees of the Local Authorities. The platform of the Digital Academy of Citizens can be the central coordination hub of all digital skills development, with the aim of wide-ranging digital actions for the acquisition of digital skills by the public sector, as well as the entire population. More specifically, it can act as a \"Collaboration Platform\" of digital education providers by coordinating, through a homogeneous national business logic, the action plan for the acquisition of digital skills related to AI, at basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. \n",
    " Encourage strategic collaborations between public sector departments and research centers / universities that excel in AI, so that the public sector employees have a continuous hands-on experience of how AI can be used to solve their problems. This interaction is suggested to build on ideathons/hackathons, where co-creation of ideas and products/services results in innovative, usable blueprints or prototypes. These workshops should be structured to address different levels of the public sector hierarchy, to enable adopters and enablers horizontally and vertically in public sector processes and services.\n",
    " Implement AI ethics-by-design training events and workshops, to ensure human-centric, ethical outcomes and increase trust, sustainability, and adoption of AI in the public sector.\n",
    "5.2.3.3 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 3: AI-TRAINING FOR PRIVATE SECTOR EXECUTIVES AND EMPLOYEES TOWARDS STRONGER AI SKILLS\n",
    "This direction targets the upskilling of private sector employees towards stronger digital competencies including AI/ML. Projects in this direction will:\n",
    " Run a national reskilling program for Computer Science professionals of all types (software engineers, backend/frontend developers, data engineers, etc), that will focus on AI, ML and data analysis skills, under an ethics-by-design prism.\n",
    " Focus on employees in other disciplines who want to use some AI technology in their work, like doctors, having as goal to help professionals to more effectively use and quickly integrate AI applications in their fields of work.\n",
    " Design and implement reskilling/upskilling training programmes for employees that will change their focus due to the automation of the job position they have.\n",
    " Help to set continuous learning as one of the basic goals of universities and colleges and provide as many as possible opportunities for lifelong learning.  \n",
    " Facilitate research centres, universities and enterprises, active in the fields of cloud computing and AI services and infrastructures, to organize short educational workshops, and seminars for companies, so that they improve their executives' and employees' AI/ML skills. These workshops should both include direct training of the employees and executives, which will also allow for innovative processes with regards to their AI/ML needs. \n",
    " Train-the-trainer programmes, which bring a multidisciplinary skill set into play, allowing decision makers in companies and organizations to integrate AI as a strategic aim, which increases sustainability.\n",
    " Complement AI-related programs, with courses in areas that could boost AI innovation such as courses in entrepreneurship.\n",
    "5.2.3.4 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 4: AI RESKILLING FOR ACADEMIA\n",
    "Several enhancements in curricula and training programs for academia is needed towards: (i) Integrating ethics-by-design, legal concerns and challenges and other multidisciplinary topics to vocational training programmes, but also academic research practices; (ii)Integrating entrepreneurial skills into academic programmes related to AI; (iii)Integrating non-technical AI-skills such as critical thinking, creativity, problem solving, etc. \n",

    "6. STRATEGIC TARGET 3 (ST3): NATIONAL AI INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM\n",
    "6.1 CURRENT STATUS - OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\n",
    "Innovation is a key component for societal and financial evolution and development, making the strengthening of innovation a challenge for greater prosperity and better lives. The innovation landscape in Greece demonstrates remarkable dynamics during the last decade, with the appearance of various related initiatives and actions that have formed the current innovation ecosystem. Following paragraphs illustrate the provisions of the strategy towards creating and sustaining the Greek AI Innovation Ecosystem. \n",
    "6.1.1 AI INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM CREATION\n",
    "According to market professionals, the capitalization of Greek-owned start-ups is estimated at €3.5 billion, up from €2.5 billion last year and zero just eight years back. This ecosystem is monitored by official platforms, such as Elevate Greece. Elevate Greece is the official platform and leading resource for in-depth information on the Greek Start-up Ecosystem, aspiring to help it grow and expand. It includes a database of registered Centres and information on the innovation ecosystem. In 2018, Athens was awarded the \"European Capital of Innovation 2018\" and received 1M Euros prize (EU). According to \"Centres in Greece\", Athens was ranked 3% higher than last year in the category of \"Founders' Choice\", while it also has the highest ranking in the category \"Value for Money\" as a start-up hub\". A step further, big companies, such as Tesla, Pfizer and EY, have invested in Greece to establish innovative R&D departments and hubs, highlighting the underlying potential. Other companies' newly established Greek branches actively seek collaborations with research laboratories and/or companies for jointly developing application specific AI technology (e.g., OHB Hellas for space applications).\n",
    "Technology parks, such as the Science and Technology Park of Crete (STEP-C), Patras Science Park (PSP), Lefkippos Technology Park, and others, have played a major role in the creation of such potential, offering fertile research and development grounds, usually in close collaboration with research and academic institutions.\n",
    "An integral part of the innovation ecosystem in Greece is the dedicated incubator and accelerator community, oftentimes paired with co-working spaces. From EGG, Corallia, and Metavallon Incubator to \"The Cube\", Found.ation and i4G, there exists a remarkable spectrum of innovation support mechanisms, empowering Centres and scale-ups alike. In most cases these incubators collaborate closely with VC funds and business angels facilitating the early-stage financing of start-ups.\n",
    "A powerful addition to the innovation ecosystem arsenal, is that of Digital Innovation Hubs (DIH) and Competence Centres.  These hubs (e.g., the data-, AI- and IoT-oriented \"ahedd\" DIH in NCSR \"Demokritos\" or the DIH-NTUA), together with innovation offices of academic organizations and universities, function as key enablers for the integration of research outcomes and know-how into innovative enterprises. European-level DIHs (such as the planned agrofood-related DIH in central Macedonia, or the planned SmartHealth DIH led by FORTH) are also significant initiatives in the Greek innovation landscape. Furthermore, CERTH is part of the first European Network of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Excellence Centres, which aims at delivering core AI advances and ensure that the European values of ethical and trustworthy AI are embedded in future AI deployments.\n",
    "The Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) launched in 2008, is the largest pan-European support infrastructure for SMEs, Centres and scale-ups, focusing on partnering and consulting services on innovation, internationalisation and access to finance. The Network comprises 3500 local experts, on 600 locations covering more than 63 countries worldwide that connect innovation support agents across Europe and beyond. PRAXI Network coordinates the Greek branch of the Network, the Enterprise Europe Network - Hellas (www.een.gr) and chairs EEN's pan European ICT sector group. \n",
    "The National Contact Points (NCP) network is composed of nationally designated experts which specialise in the details and modalities of the European Commission's Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation. ICT has a dedicated NCP specialising on various subareas including Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.\n",
    "Enterprise Greece is another support structure aiming to facilitate the extroversion of Greek enterprises and the attraction of foreign investments in the Greek economy and businesses. \n",
    "Finally, Innovation offices such as PRAXI Network, provide advisory and partnering services towards SMEs, focusing in the areas of access to finance, innovation management, IPR and digital transformation. Utilising international connections and participation in transnational networks, innovation offices also provide partnering opportunities for innovation co-development and IPR commercialisation.\n",
    "In addition to formally established support structures, one should note a number of emerged open or informal communities which have developed as a result of the AI- and data-related innovation opportunities and challenges that arise in Greece. From the Hellenic Free Open Source Software Community (ELLAK) -with its significant history and contribution to open innovation-, to the Greek branch of the MyData community and the enthusiasts' meetup groups (e.g., the Deep Learning Meetup community or the Athens AI Meetup community, which number hundreds of members), grassroot movements almost complete the puzzle of main stakeholders regarding the Innovation Ecosystem Creation aspect of this overview. \n",
    "Another issue of critical importance is that of legislation. To empower the above vibrant communities, by improving its low score on the innovation-friendly environment metrics (EIS, 2020), Greece has initiated several actions to tackle existing challenges, such as a bill to simplify the licensing of business activities (Minister of Development and Investment, Nov 2020).\n",
    "Based on the above analysis, the current state of the Greek innovation ecosystem combines promising dynamics, with facilitating support actions, which - combined with appropriate infrastructure and training (as per Strategic Targets 1 and 2), as well as sustainability actions - can foster a fertile AI innovation environment. The combination of this fertility with ethical considerations under a democratic perspective (Strategic Target 6) is expected to maximize the impact of all related innovative endeavours to the wider community, under a human-centric perspective.\n",
    "6.1.2 AI INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM SUSTAINABILITY\n",
    "Concerning funding, during the last few years several important initiatives have supported the Greek innovation ecosystem, including AI-enabled settings. \n",
    "On the private funding side, the establishment of Equifund, a fund of funds launched by the Hellenic Republic in cooperation with the European Investment Fund (EIF), is a primary source of financing, boasting a significant funding portfolio and collaborating funding entities, but one can find additional Private Equity and VC initiatives, such as Openfund and Brookstreet equity. \n",
    "Other private funding includes, of course, efforts such as the investment of big enterprises in R&D within the Greek borders (such as the EY, Pfizer and related cases described above). There are also actions related to Corporate Social Responsibility (e.g., the case of Eurobank), or domain specific innovation competitions (e.g., FinQuest by Alpha Bank), including investment for internal innovation actions (e.g., COSMOTE InnovatiON).\n",
    "On the public funding side, both national and international opportunities for start-ups exist through various programmes. Research and Innovation funding comes mainly from national programmes, launched by the General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT) such as the \"RESEARCH - CREATE - INNOVATE'' actions, or regional programmes such as the Research and Innovation Synergies in Attica. All regions have dedicated programmes and actions focusing on R&I activities for SMEs relating to their RIS3 strategy. Bilateral programmes between Greece and other nations (e.g., Israel and Germany) provide additional funding opportunities and promote transnational cooperation for innovation development.\n",
    "At the EU level, the European Commission's Framework Programmes are the key European funding instruments for research and innovation activities in Europe. They cover all areas of science and technology and through specialised committees adjust and update the programmes according to scientific, technological and market trends. In its current Programme, Horizon 2020 and its subsequent one from 2021, Horizon Europe, Artificial Intelligence has entered strongly as a subject in dedicated calls. AI funding is mainly realised through three main instruments: the European Research Council (ERC) which funds promising, early stage research with the aim to develop further the state of the art and establish leadership in a technological or scientific field, the  European Innovation Council (EIC) which provides funding to innovators aiming to bring to the market breakthrough technologies and solutions and the Public-private partnerships (PPPs) which will facilitate stepping up private investment.  It is important to note that there is a significant number of Greek stakeholders active in the field of AI, who managed to compete internationally and secure funding from the European Commission. In Horizon 2020, and for calls related to AI, there were 148 participations in 87 funded projects (signed grants) securing in excess of 45.9 million euros.  Although the highest participation was from Universities and RTOs, more than a third of participants were SMEs.\n",
    "Another EU initiative comes from the EIT Digital action, which includes an \"Innovation Factory\", an \"Entrepreneurial Academy\" and an accelerator. Within the European Economic Area, one can find additional funding opportunities for Greek innovators, such as the EEA Grants.\n",
    "In the area of national defence, which is among the priorities for Greece, a host of AI projects and initiatives are expected to be funded by the European Defence Agency (EDA).\n",
    "Beyond funding, AI innovation sustainability requires AI-aware thought leaders and pioneers in all aspects of societal and financial action. The emergence of such individuals builds upon public awareness events and training seminars or workshops. In Greece there exist several related actions. Hackathons, matchathons, ideathons and other related events have taken place, covering a variety of domains from health (e.g., https://www.euvsvirus.org/) to fintech, social innovation and agrotech among others.\n",
    "On the other hand, series of public seminars (e.g., NCSR \"Demokritos\", SciFY Academy, Laskarides Foundation seminars in collaboration with the Hellenic AI Society, EETN, among others) increase awareness of the AI potential horizontally, while domain-specific conferences and workshops allow cross-fertilization between the AI experts' community and a number of industries (e.g., see SETN's 2020 workshops on \"Law and AI\", \"AI and Physical Sciences\", \"Games and AI\"), catalysing innovation.\n",
    "Recently, the osmosis between research centres and innovative firms has been significantly strengthened by the inauguration of \"industrial PhD\" programmes (e.g., see the corresponding action of NCSR \"Demokritos\"). These programs allow the design and application of cutting-edge AI (e.g., deep reinforcement learning, XAI) in a multitude of domains, from material science to robotics, the IoT and the Semantic Web. Finally, our overview indicated a limited but important set of vocational training actions on innovation (see for example the corresponding courses on the e-learning platform of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens), but also targeted executive trainings by research institutions towards enterprises and Centres (see the NCSR \"Demokritos\" DIH, custom workshops, among others). \n",
    "Once again, at this point, we highlight national policies that can empower sustainability in AI innovation. Within the national digital policies, including the development planning and regulatory legislation, innovation gets increased support. This fact is coupled by the bill to simplify the licensing of business activities (Minister of Development and Investment, Nov 2020), facilitating innovative entrepreneurship. However, AI can also empower social innovation. To this end, public organizations have already participated in innovation actions (e.g., the Ministry of Work and Social affairs led a Greek consortium for the EU \"Competence centres for social innovation\" call), indicating government commitment to a wider innovation scope.\n",
    "6.1.3 SUMMARY OF OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVEMENT POINTS\n",
    "Based on the above overview and several studies published during the last few years, we identify several opportunities and potential improvements that can empower AI-related innovation.\n",
    "Given the numerous AI innovators with success stories across domains - including big firms that strategically invest in AI [BCG20] - the world-class AI expertise, and the existing successful innovating spin-offs and Centres, one would need to increase the experimentation potential on AI technologies, in a pre-deployment, controlled setting (see also the EC-proposed TEFs). Such action could reduce the time-to-market and reduce ethics and adoption-related risks. This action could also exploit the role of big AI firms, which understand the potential of AI and need to strategically invest in related endeavours (BCG, 2020; Accenture, 2019) to lead to a network of early adopters across different domains. We expect that this could also push businesses and organizations (including civil society representatives) towards more prompt digitization, to increase the degree of digitization which currently remains low.\n",
    "As a second opportunity, the recent inauguration of MSc programmes in AI, Data Science and related domains with significant participation from companies could lead to an increase in AI research results. Industrial PhDs could play also a key role in the collaboration between academia and industry. Since Greece lags in the exploitation of research results as company assets, due among other things to the limited connection between high-calibre knowledge holders (PhDs) and the industry, it would be wise to employ a nation-wide technology-transfer effort, which would strategically support exploitation of scientific results. Such effort would need to build upon efficient processes aiming for the open and/or commercial exploitation of research results.\n",
    "Another important step would be to empower large, state-owned enterprises with AI innovation to increase their sustainability and provide improved services to their wide clientele, maximizing the impact of AI. Besides large enterprises, sustainability, social responsibility and societal impact Investments on AI Startups are on the rise worldwide. This represents an opportunity fully aligned to the Democratic AI goals of the strategy.\n",
    "Another opportunity is based on that Greece has a high score on innovative SMEs collaborating with others and SMEs innovating in-house (EIS, 2020). This potential could fuel a national AI marketplace, aligned to European initiatives such as AI4EU, to allow efficient (re)use of AI components in multiple settings, products, and services.\n",
    "The above actions need to build on an efficient ecosystem monitoring mechanism, which will support informed decisions by all stakeholders through open reporting and information sharing. Such action will be combined with the co-creation and leveraging of national support mechanisms for sustainability, through the involvement of key stakeholders. The aim would be to create strategically appropriate financing options and raise awareness for these options to innovators and related organizations and bodies, ascertaining sustainability over time. \n",
    "6.2 MAIN STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS\n",
    "6.2.1 AI INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM CREATION\n",
    "6.2.1.1 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 1: NATIONAL AI INNOVATION PROCESSES AND REGISTRY\n",
    "Given the low research asset generation (e.g., patents), DIH (and innovation offices where available) will create a portfolio of AI-related technologies - in close collaboration with the academia and the industry - and aim for joint patent (including non-aggressive patents for public use, or open) submissions, under private-public funding. The expected outcome would be:\n",
    " A process identifying innovation opportunities, supporting academia and companies to create AI intellectual property (IP) assets, each directly mapped to innovative organizations with commercial capacity (including SMEs, spin-offs, but also existing big players, as well as social innovators).\n",
    " An online, openly available registry of the above opportunities, allowing efficient management of the related data and facilitating mapping to the industry.\n",
    " A co-funding for the IP assets generation to strengthen exploitation.\n",
    " A sustainability plan for the registry, to allow operation beyond the end of the project.\n",
    "In the mid- and long-term the registry is meant to enhance exploitation capabilities to the wider research and innovation ecosystem, also providing policy suggestions to improve the current legal environment. It is also meant to identify horizontal AI opportunities for innovation in the public and private sector, and catalyse the innovation process by decreasing time-to-market.\n",
    "6.2.1.2 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 2: ESTABLISH AI TESTING AND EXPERIMENTATION FACILITIES - DIGITAL INNOVATION HUBS - AI CENTRES\n",
    "AI Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs) will be established at a local, regional and national scale. They will constitute the controlled environments where AI innovations can be co-created, evaluated and matured, in order to minimize risks, maximize positive impact and ascertain socio-cultural compatibility with the deployment settings. The TEFs could be directly linked to existing Digital Innovation Hub facilities - especially living labs settings -, technology parks, incubators and accelerators, to maximize the impact and allow for cross-fertilization and maturing of best practices. The TEFs should also be accessible to a representative set of non-experts and multidisciplinary experts, so that AI products can converge to socio-culturally acceptable and impactful assets. Thus, innovation requirements could evolve to include cutting-edge explainable AI (XAI) solutions, democratized AI products through AutoML approaches, as well as safe, secure and transparent products and services. Finally, these TEFs could be a setting for the implementation of theses (BSc, MSc, PhD) of different disciplines, providing insights on large scale application of AI technologies, the related challenges and possible solutions. Essentially the following directions must be considered:\n",
    " The definition of priority thematic domains (in alignment to the existing priorities of the strategy), together with appropriate stakeholders, utilizing novel infrastructures (e.g., 5G for real-time AIoT applications).\n",
    " The initiation and funding of pilot TEFs, in selected appropriate environments and settings, possibly through innovation vouchers.\n",
    " The execution of dissemination actions, through fora aiming at the convergence of the pilots.\n",
    " The sharing of results and related best practices for the evolution of TEFs.\n",
    "In the mid-term and long-term these TEFs are meant to be innovation enablers and points of reference, sharing the gained expertise in innovative experimentation with the wider community. The gained expertise will also be invaluable within the scope of trans-national initiatives, spanning e.g., all the EU, supporting the efficient democratisation of AI.\n",
    "6.2.1.3 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 3: ENGAGE LARGE ENTERPRISES (INCLUDING STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES) IN AI-PLAY AND AI INNOVATION\n",
    "Large enterprises should engage in AI innovators as both data providers and innovators. For example, large state-owned enterprises will be incentivized to delve into their data silos and launch calls asking for AI-based solutions on well-defined problems (e.g., EYDAP Innovation Challenge7). These calls will help these enterprises to reshape the traditional revenue models, create new products and better services for their clients, and improve their operational cost base. Furthermore, they will incentivize start-ups and individual entrepreneurs to participate. The organization of similar actions should entail the following steps:\n",
    " Identification and summary of datasets available per enterprise.\n",
    " Organization of ideation events (e.g., ideathons) to converge to possible AI-enabled uses of the datasets (whether internal or by third parties) for the provision of new products and services, improvement of current services or innovation within the enterprise. Such events should be multi-disciplinary, to allow a human-centric exploration of the potential of cutting-edge AI results over the spectrum of operations, such as: AIoT and digital twins for proactive maintenance and network optimization; deep neural models and AI-powered dialogue systems (chatbots) for efficient knowledge management and customer support; reinforcement learning and motion planning for optimized HMI; edge AI for autonomous driving or safety and security settings, etc.\n",
    " Calls for pilot implementations, funding SMEs, industrial players, research groups, or other innovative teams to run pilots, based on the predefined ideas.\n",
    " Share the outcome of the pilots, both as case studies and best practices.\n",
    "In the mid- and long-term this direction should leverage testing and experimentation facilities to further develop the successful pilot outcomes. It will also aim at the creation of new paradigms of data sharing (e.g., sectoral data spaces) for the empowerment of all related stakeholders (including enterprises, data analysts, researchers, etc.). Finally, the direction is expected to contribute to an AI-aware culture beyond the borders of the large enterprises through success stories, but also challenges faced and best practices.\n",
    "Emphasis should be paid in the active engagement of the large state-owned enterprises in the National AI ecosystem, given that some of these enterprises possess large datasets and can directly benefits from innovative solutions to business problems (e.g., increasing their resilience). Nevertheless, large private sector enterprises in data-intensive industries could be engaged as well. The latter tend to produce very large datasets, which currently remain largely unexploited.\n",
    "6.2.1.4 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 4: AI INNOVATION NETWORK: BRIDGING CENTRES AND SMES\n",
    "Large companies scan the business environment to identify and exploit innovative ideas developed in Centres, outside their established businesses. At the same time, start-ups seek support from large companies due to their strong boosting effect. Although much of the focus is on collaboration between start-ups and large companies, SMEs could support and collaborate with more start-ups than large companies do, due to their agility and innovation capacity. Also, SMEs could enhance their innovation process with limited investments. \n",
    "SMEs should be incentivized to launch systematic, collaborative activity (contractually defined) with Centres, and encourage the collaborative development of innovative solutions. Also, Incubators/Accelerators should focus more on making the identification of SMEs as possible users of new technologies more accessible to start-ups, as well as making start-ups more identifiable by SMEs.\n",
    "In the mid-term, a collaboration culture will be developed, acting as a multiplication factor to individual investments. This could also help support innovation actions across sectors, where the transferability of lessons learnt in one domain of application can significantly reduce the time-to-market for a similar domain. Finally, activities for incentivizing an entrepreneurial spirit must be planned, increasing the impact of Centres and pre-existing SMEs alike, in a highly competitive environment.\n",
    "6.2.1.5 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 5: ESTABLISH A NATIONAL AI MARKETPLACE \n",
    "Access to AI resources and assets produced in the country could be facilitate through the National AI Marketplace. In this direction, a distributed AI Marketplace for algorithms, data, AI applications, AI solutions and services (demand and supply of diverse AI services) will be developed to serve as a national open collaboration platform on AI. It will be complementary to international related efforts (e.g., AI4EU) and (if possible) linked to them. The platform will integrate a wide range of diverse, crowd-driven (citizen, research & academia, private and public sectors) AI algorithms, datasets and AI solutions, which will be offered to the community. These assets should also include linguistic resources, supporting the analysis and use of the Greek language in AI pipelines.\n",
    "A distinct aspect of this platform will be the 'AI innovation start-up Hub' that will provide an overview of the AI tools, applications and services that have been created at a National level. In order to foster trust in this online platform, audit mechanisms (technical, ethical, etc.) will be established in order to ensure the necessary multi-thematic standards, which can be complemented via community-driven reputation mechanisms. Security aspects will be ensured as well as accessibility, openness and inclusivity of diverse stakeholder segments.\n",
    "The AI Marketplace will foster collaboration and co-creation of diverse ecosystem actors. It will act as one stop-shop at a national level for AI related services (provision and trading) and will provide a range of innovation support services (business, technical support, training, etc.) across lifecycle stages of AI-driven innovation for individual entrepreneurs, Centres and scale-ups in addition to SMEs and larger companies (across their digital and AI transformation journeys). This platform could form the basis for fostering active collaboration, establish partnerships and new AI collaborative projects/initiatives (with high potential economic impact, social impact, environmental/sustainability impact) between research, academia, Centres, investors and funds, private sector and public sector entities in Greece and in the broader South East Europe.\n",
    "Incentives for contributing to the marketplace will be considered. For example, selected data providers will be rewarded for the amount and quality of the data they provide to the hub.\n",
    "This platform could be part of the 'Elevate Greece' platform and strengthen its cause, that is to make Greece the next major hub in innovation in South East Europe. Potentially, the AI marketplace will comprise best of breed AI resources from both the public and the private sector to the benefit of all.\n",
    "In the medium and long term, this marketplace could integrate separate sector-specific AI Marketplaces and hubs (i.e., Health, Manufacturing, Maritime, Tourism, Agriculture, etc), addressing the needs of distinct communities and stakeholders. Furthermore, an AI-powered digital transformation hub could also be created in order to assist companies lagging behind in their digital transformation journeys by providing the necessary AI tools, services and support. \n",
    "The development of the marketplace shall take advantage of fully open, and modern Web technologies (e.g., schema.org) to facilitate discovery of AI resources by mainstream search engines (e.g., Google).\n",
    "6.2.2 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 6: SUPPORT NATIONAL SCALE TECHNOLOGY-TRANSFER EFFORTS\n",
    "For existing research groups in the areas of AI, there needs to be a national strategy in place to commercially exploit mature research results either through technology transfer activities or through the assistance and establishment of spin-offs or new start-ups.\n",
    "Another important aspect concerns the development of know-how, innovative technological processes, original devices, and final products which constitute the Intellectual Property of research institutes. This IP can be further utilized offering a significant benefit to the development and prosperity of the wider society. In this direction the mobilization of the Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) of Universities and Research Centres will be considered. \n",
    "Utilization of the results of the research activity carried out at research institutes, that is, the Intellectual Property of research institutes, for the benefit and use of the wider society, is one of the most important components of research and social policy of the institution. It is a key axis of his social contribution, as -through the transfer of knowledge to production- part of public resources spent on research returns to society, creating added value.\n",
    "This contribution is implemented in many ways, such as: (i) The transfer of new knowledge to the undergraduate and postgraduate students of the institution; (ii) The publication of the research results in Greek and International scientific magazines and conferences; (iii) The provision of technical advice to the State and the institutionalized bodies of; (iv) The provision of technical advice and support to Greek and foreign companies; (v) The patenting of original methods-technologies-products with patents; (vi) Concluding contracts for the transfer or use of technology with existing companies or spin-offs.\n",
    "It is therefore clear that the scope of cooperation between research institutes and industry, can be developed in a wide range of activities: by Research & Technological Development, the development of innovation and new entrepreneurship, Technology transfer, but also Training in issues related to innovation management, productive systems, innovation systems and more broadly industrial development and technological change.\n",
    "6.2.3 AI INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM SUSTAINABILITY\n",
    "6.2.3.1 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 7: A NETWORK OF EARLY ADOPTERS \n",
    "Established pre-existing practices, as is the case of the Israeli AI strategy, aims to create a network of early adopters for AI technologies, utilizing appropriate pre-existing environments (e.g., smart cities) to test various disruptive AI innovations, such as autonomous cars, etc. \n",
    "Since innovation is about bringing inventions out to society and making them have an impact, it is important for companies to have access to a proper environment to try out things, namely the Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs). However, a second level of application for the successful outcomes of the TEFs if that of the real-world environment. But such an environment is built step-by-step and this is the path that must be strategically followed. \n",
    "The preparation of a fertile innovation environment involves a significant cultural shift, since people, organizations, and the society overall will have to be willing to co-create the final AI systems, or even collaborate with AI, in an Augmented Intelligence setting. Greece can promote this shift by building and nurturing a network of people, companies, and organizations (even cities, such as Trikala, Karditsa, Chalkida and others) that are more prone and ready to adopt new technologies and test innovations, facing the challenges of innovation fine-tuning and customization for the specific community.\n",
    "In the mid-term this network of early adopters is meant to mature the wider eco-system, through sharing the gained know-how, identifying common pitfalls and challenges as well as the related mitigation actions. Furthermore, it will create the critical mass of innovators and thought leaders in the society, in conjunction with training actions of ST2, to build a powerful and democratic (cf. ST6) AI-aware society. \n",
    "6.2.3.2 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 8: MONITOR AND TRACK THE INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM IN THE SCOPE OF THE AI OBSERVATORY\n",
    "To ascertain a sustainable ecosystem, one needs to identify key stakeholders, innovative players, the related existing and desired skillset, as well as opportunities (including funding) and challenges that arise over time. To this end, the Hellenic AI Observatory will include a section for stakeholders and activities of the Innovation Ecosystem. The aim of this part of the Observatory will be to gather and track information on the AI innovation ecosystem, forming an iteratively updated outline of the - constantly changing - network of stakeholders. \n",
    "Hence, the AI Observatory will facilitate the production of periodic reports on the findings, essentially offering a constant, trustworthy information source for challenges and opportunities on all innovation aspects of AI, such as: (a) Innovative AI systems and services; (b) AI adoption; (c) Public trust and understanding of AI; (d) Funding; (e) International initiatives.\n",
    "In the long run, the observatory could become a major point of reference for the innovative aspects of AI, covering numerous of the required points of view and perspectives. As such, it will be an invaluable resource for informed decision making at all policy making levels (including enterprise decision making).\n",
    "6.2.3.3 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 9: LEVERAGING NATIONAL SUPPORT MECHANISMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY\n",
    "Access to Finance options and Access to Finance strategies can be co-developed with the assistance of key stakeholders, which have been supporting SMEs on this front for years. Efforts should also focus on attracting private funds to invest in Greece. To achieve this a mapping and promotional strategy is needed, running key events to raise awareness of such mechanisms and the kind of support they provide. \n",
    "At the same time, changes in legislation are required in order to create an investor-friendly environment. Such changes concern a stable taxation system, modern IPR management legislation with provisions for AI-create IPR, alignment with European policies.\n",
    "Information from the AI Innovation Ecosystem Observatory can be used to design and implement awareness-raising events and matchmaking events, that will foster: (i)The attraction of private funds to AI-powered Centres, spin-offs, SMEs but also big AI-aware companies; and (ii)The maturing of the current legislative environment to facilitate and incentivize such investments.\n",
    "In the mid-term, the goal is to create a fertile and friendly investment landscape for AI innovation efforts, maximizing the value and attractiveness of the Greek AI eco-system as an entrepreneurial setting.\n",

    "7. STRATEGIC TARGET 4 (ST4): AI FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR\n",
    "7.1 CURRENT STATUS - OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\n",
    "7.1.1 INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE OF ST4\n",
    "The objective of this Strategic Target is to accelerate the adoption, development, and integration of AI solutions in the private sector as an enabler of digital transformation and sustainable economic growth. \n",
    "This strategic target will be achieved by the actions in various strategic directions, which aim to increase private sector awareness on AI, provide incentives and support mechanisms for the use of AI by all sectors and types of companies.\n",
    "In this context, legislative/regulatory, technical, commercial/operational, and trust challenges need to be addressed. By addressing these challenges, the private sector shall ensure that AI is a growth vehicle that is placed at the service of the people, the society and the environment, being democratic, trustworthy and sustainable for all for the shared common good.\n",
    "7.1.2 EXISTING AI-RELATED PRIVATE SECTOR INITIATIVES\n",
    "AI adoption is hurdled by the overall low digital maturity of Greece (refer to DESI -Digital Economy and Society Index). In that respect and if no actions are taken the projected economic growth that AI can infuse into the Greek economy in the upcoming years will be low compared to other countries, as illustrated in a recent research report by Accenture and Frontier Economics that focused on projections for the period 2020-2035. \n",
    "At the same time both the public and the private sector have already started smaller or bigger activities towards the use and adoption of AI technologies in solving society's complex problems. \n",
    "Large corporates from various sectors as Financial Services, Telecommunications, Manufacturing, Power and Utilities, etc. that do own large data sets have started using AI in areas as customer interaction (chatbots, voice assistants, etc.), marketing (providing personalized content or offers), operations (preventive maintenance, process automation with combined use of AI and Robotic Process Automation - in standardized processes with low to medium technical integration complexity), risk assessment, fraud detection, and overall decision support. Most of the investments and efforts are currently focused mainly on setting the foundations, thus in data governance, data and platforms infrastructure set up and interaction, big data lake hydration, as well as operationalization of AI use cases.  As a subsequent step, large organizations seek the right path to establish organizational readiness and efficiency in terms of building awareness on how AI can benefit all organizational functions, acting with agility, and creating the needed skill sets.  \n",
    "The awareness gap is much wider in Small to Medium Enterprises, where decision makers and employees are missing business and technical knowledge, and clear guidelines on the ethical use of AI adoption. This limits SMEs investment and experimentation appetite towards AI (even in the \"simple\" AI solutions).\n",
    "At the same time, there are stronger positive signs coming for early and mature (Greek) Centres that based on AI created successful business models e.g., Workable, Innoetics, Persado.\n",
    "Lastly international organizations invest in locating regional Digital solution hubs in Greece as Pfizer's Digital Hub in Thessaloniki, EY's CESA Data & Analytics Centre of Excellence in Athens, and NCSR Demokritos and EY Global Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence.\n",
    "The Greek private sector innovation and investment appetite has been hit by the long financial crisis ,as well as the current COVID-19 health and economic crisis. Nevertheless, the upcoming period offers a very favourable environment for investment in enabling technologies as AI. Both private (e.g., Equifund), public - national and EU (Recovery fund, Horizon, ESPA, Public Investment Plan, etc.) as well as mix like the innovative concept of Phaistos fund aimed for sectoral 5G enabled solutions (AI including) using a mix of public and private financing.\n",
    "The successful adoption and development of AI solutions could: \n",
    "1. Accelerate competitiveness of Greek exportable services / products. Based on recent studies (e.g., 5G strategy and objectives, EY Study for Ministry of Digital Governance) there are sectors that qualify as most attractive to receive the benefits of AI (in terms of GVA, exports, social impact, use of ICT services, int'l benchmarks). These sectors are manufacturing (incl. mining and construction), transport and logistics, agriculture, power and utilities, ICT, health and tourism (thus the latter not an official economic sector).\n",
    "2. Trigger and stimulate investments at various levels, for example: \n",
    "o In terms of int' companies locating in Greece digital and analytics their regional / global solution centres benefiting of local pool of highly skilled, English speaking resources and the Greek environment and life-style\n",
    "o Creating new business models - players in the data value chain (data brokers, AI application providers, etc.)\n",
    "3. Improve health, safety, and environmental conditions. AI solutions can drastically improve working conditions in terms of health and safety, especially in cases of manufacturing, mining, construction, transport, and logistics. \n",
    "4. Improve customer/user experience. The use of AI will eventually provide better services and products to the end customers; thus, improving their overall quality of living.\n",
    "To formulate a successful AI strategy for the private sector, we consider it important to identify and address, where possible, the key related challenges.\n",
    "7.1.3 PRIVATE SECTOR CHALLENGES FOR AI ADOPTION\n",
    "The challenges related to successful adoption and development of AI in the Greek private sector could be categorized in Technical, Commercial and Operational, the ones related to Trust. A full list of identified challenges appears in Table 4.\n",
    "Category/Nature\n",
    "Challenges\n",
    "Technical\n",
    " Low volumes (depth and richness of data), even in large organizations, there is a large amount of data sources not exploited (collected and managed).\n",
    " Low use of IoT in infrastructure, household, sectors -> no large volumes of IoT data.\n",
    " Most organizations are tackling with data management issues rather than AI solution development.\n",
    " Missing sectoral / functional common data models / standardization for cross-organization / sector co-operation.\n",
    " Data and Models that are GR specific: NLP GR solutions missing (e.g., chatbots, virtual assistants etc.), GR flora/agricultural production, GR culture. \n",
    " Shift from pilots to large scale operational use.\n",
    " Low awareness of the fast evolving technologies, tools and practices. Small % of senior / mid management as well experienced personnel (technical and business) understands  AI or has skills.\n",
    " Brain drain; A plethora of skilled resources with AI related academic background have found or still seek employment abroad.\n",
    "Commercial & Operational\n",
    " Fragmented sectors (too many players) result to fragmented data sets, that limit the case of using AI.\n",
    " Low R&D investment and risk appetite from large organizations.\n",
    " Current applications of AI are built within organizations leveraging \"Own data\".\n",
    " AI SMEs not having access to large \"sanitized\" production data to test/train their products.\n",
    " No external monetization use cases for AI; no clear business case, no evident business model to provide data - everyone wants to sell their data, not buy.\n",
    " AI seen as a \"competitive advantage\" rather than an exportable service / knowledge.\n",
    " Low penetration of cloud solutions (both in large corporates and SMEs)\n",
    " Unclear data broker model.\n",
    " Lagging in mobile high bandwidth connectivity vs. EU (not so much coverage but actual adoption).\n",
    " Lack of in-house knowledge related to AI strategy and governance (AI disrupts organizational decisioning frameworks).\n",
    "Trust Related\n",
    " Education on ethical/robust AI and AI principles (\"What good AI looks like\"). Both from the side of users and producers of AI solutions.\n",
    " Ambiguity on legislation / regulation e.g., how to \"justify\" AI results in   autonomous vehicles, risk credit scores, insurance use cases etc.\n",
    " Data protection rules and % of users that provide consent.\n",
    "Table 4: Challenges for AI Adoption and Use by the Greek Private Sector\n",
    "7.2 MAIN STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS\n",
    "Based on the key challenges identified it is considered crucial that in the near-term period (next 2-3 years) public policy actions should focus on: First, establishing the necessary foundations for AI use (infrastructure, regulation, skills, etc.), and second, bridging the skills gap and creating awareness on AI and its benefits to all direct and indirect stakeholders. \n",
    "In parallel, forward -looking actions for private sector regarding unlocking new business models and private sector experimentation and innovation based on AI must be undertaken with specific focus on priority sectors as manufacturing (incl. mining and construction), transport and logistics (included shipping), agriculture, power and utilities, health, ICT, and tourism. Other important areas like National Defence as discussed in ST5.\n",
    "7.2.1 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 1: FOSTER AND SUPPORT INVESTMENTS IN ENABLING INFRASTRUCTURES (CLOUD, COMPUTING RESOURCES, IOT, 5G) - FOCUS ON SMES\n",
    "Given the strategic focus on extending and facilitating access to national AI infrastructures (ST1), there is a need for maximizing and optimizing the usage of AI infrastructures (national but also private) by the industry and in particular SMEs., \n",
    "An important aspect is the provision of test-before-invest infrastructures via the opening of national infrastructure(s) at no or little cost, via the establishment of industrial access programmes and the access to DIH (Digital Innovation Hubs) and EDIH (European Digital Innovation Hubs) assets for small-scale experiments and demonstrators. In operational settings, the mobilization of industry chambers and business unions for the bulk provision of equipment and the inclusion of industry-targeting infrastructure in national contracts is a good initiator for technology penetration in the industry.\n",
    "The Greek state could also support financially private investments in AI infrastructures to facilitate AI operational use adoption, focusing ideally on selected sectors and SMEs.\n",
    "The strategic direction will be pursued in some of the following ways:\n",
    " Performing AI Strategy sectoral studies to quantify impact of AI and identify priority AI domains and use cases. Priority sectors suggested are those reflected in previous/background studies about the growth potential of the Greek economy i.e.  manufacturing (incl. mining and construction), transport and logistics, biotechnology, agriculture, power and utilities, ICT, health and tourism. Furthermore, emphasis must be paid in areas where the country has potential competitive advantages such as the maritime sector (e.g., Autonomous Electric Vessels) and Cultural Heritage. Likewise, sectors where large amounts of data are readily available (e.g., the Digital Finance and Finance Technology (FinTech) sector where the PSD II regulation has unlocked large data volumes) will be seriously considered as well.\n",
    " Supporting the development of experimentation infrastructures and testbeds for private sector enterprises. As a prominent example, infrastructures for manufacturing enterprises (e.g., pilot lines) and agricultural companies (e.g., field testbeds comprising sensors and UAVs) could be established, as already outlined in ST1 and ST3. \n",
    " Provide support for access to Connectivity and Cloud/Supercomputing resources (e.g., using schemes like coupons and promotional credits) in order to test and pilot of AI applications. This is particularly important for SMEs that typically lack the equity capital to undertake such R&D investments.\n",
    "In conjunction with government-dependent activities, an important aspect is the establishment of collaboration fora for defining and monitoring an open data marketplace for private data, where different companies will contribute parts of their data assets to be used by others in a mutually beneficial environment.\n",
    "7.2.2 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 2: DEFINE SECTORIAL DATA MODELS & AI METHODOLOGIES \n",
    " This direction targets the combination of data models, rules (ontologies) and ML/DL models to create more powerful, transparent, explainable and trusted AI systems in order to facilitate the adoption and wider use of AI developments by both the private and public sectors. Priority sectors considered: manufacturing (incl. mining and construction), transport and logistics, agriculture, power and utilities, ICT, and tourism.\n",
    "The challenges to be overcome include: (i)Data and model sharing consensus between enterprises that are active in each sector may be difficult; and (ii)The development of AI models per sector can be time and effort intensive.\n",
    "To achieve the above-mentioned targets, work in the following sub-directions could be pursued by the private sector in close collaboration, where possible, with the public sector:\n",
    " To develop a catalogue of sectors and the respective data models. The catalogue should also contain instructions on how to share and use sectoral data.\n",
    " To select and focus on a set of main use cases which are significant for each sector and to which AI/ML models can be applied in order to boost economic growth. Create, publish, and disseminate information on the most prominent value-added applications of AI in various sectors, along with roadmaps and best practices for realizing them.\n",
    " Fund the development of reference, technology showcasing projects in major sectors of the economy. Disseminate showcases at sector level in collaboration with relevant associations, innovation clusters, AI centres and DIHs. This links to relevant activities of ST3.\n",
    " To encourage mapping of the different enterprise data schemas to sector specific schemas in order to achieve interoperability and the re-use of the developed AI models.\n",
    " To adopt data sharing between data providers/creators both at public and private domains. \n",
    " To foster the collaboration between enterprises to develop schemata/data models and rules (ontologies) per sector.  \n",
    " To create common competitions/challenges for academia and enterprises to develop and share AI/ML models for the chosen use cases and shared data, possibly through some financial incentives/awards. \n",
    "7.2.3 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 3: FACILITATE PRIVATE (CROSS-)SECTOR DATA SHARING / MONETIZING FRAMEWORK INCL. DATA BROKERS\n",
    "This direction is destined to facilitate data sharing across private sector enterprises, including sharing of proprietary datasets. To the end the data hubs that will be established in ST1 as national infrastructures for private data sharing will be exploited. \n",
    "7.2.4 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 4: DEFINE PUBLIC - PRIVATE DATA SHARING FRAMEWORK AND TOOLS\n",
    "Defining a Public - Private data sharing framework and providing the necessary tools to companies to embark on the AI era is of great importance for fostering AI. Greece should establish a Government data strategy that sets out action plans to manage data as a strategic asset and deepen the collection and use of data. As a first step should be the enrichment of the data.gov.gr, registering all the data sources and available data currently at hand and then developing a strategy to enhance the data set. Towards this initiative a public - private data sharing framework could be of help.\n",
    "The strategic direction can be pursued based on the following fine-grained activities:\n",
    " Develop a Public sector data strategy that would enable data collection and management as well as data sharing between Government agencies. It should be centred on the public sector putting in place the organisational structures, technical systems, and processes and capabilities to manage and use data across its lifecycle, from problem statement definition to exploitation.\n",
    " Define the Public - Private data sharing framework & tools. As the nation's custodian of personal and administrative data, the Government holds a data resource that many companies find valuable. The Government can help drive cross-sectoral data sharing and innovation by curating, cleaning, and providing the private sector with access to Government datasets. The envisaged Public-Private Data Sharing Framework will facilitate the sharing of Government data with non-Government entities (NGEs) and key commercial partners, by defining the scope, type, granularity, and safeguards (people, process, and technical) of Government data that can be shared with the private sector. \n",
    " Establish trusted data intermediaries for public - private data exchange. The Government will identify organisations to serve as trusted data intermediaries for data fusion and distribution. These trusted entities could be situated in either the private or public sector, depending on the sector, type of data, and where most data are sited.\n",
    " Define and promulgate common data standards to ensure data interoperability. To facilitate data fusion, the Government will work with companies in key sectors to define and promulgate a set of common data standards for the sector (e.g., standards for health records across restructured hospitals, private GPs and research institutes).\n",
    " Curate and publish a meta-data catalogue of public-private datasets required to implement the National AI Projects. We will also work with the trusted data intermediaries to define common data standard and technical safeguards to anonymize, secure, and provide companies and researchers with access to these data. This will help facilitate data discovery and anchor data and AI collaboration between Government agencies, industry, and researchers.\n",
    "7.2.5 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 5: FOSTER SME INNOVATION \n",
    "Public sector organizations (including SMEs) should be offered easy access to DIH, AI Centres, Clusters and other innovation support structures of the national AI innovation ecosystem. The importance of establishing and reinforcing such structures for both the public and the private sector has been elaborated in ST3. \n",
    "7.2.6 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 6: FINANCE AND INCENTIVIZE R&D FOR AI\n",
    "Companies are looking for an ally for a successful growth strategy leveraging AI, looking for ways to improve their productivity, increase their flexibility and boost customer satisfaction rates through automation. Also, faster access of new products and services to the market is another key reason for implementing AI. There are, however, several factors that discourage businesses from turning to artificial intelligence solutions. The high cost of obtaining the relevant solutions and the lack of specialized personnel to evaluate them are the main factors that hinder the development and application of AI technology in organizations and companies. For this reason, the Greek government must provide incentives for leveraging artificial intelligence in the private sector but also to claim relevant funding from European programs for innovative businesses and Centres.\n",
    "In this direction there will be a need for initiatives that: (i)Reduce the cost of obtaining the AI solutions (i.e., the Total Cost of Ownership of AI solutions for Private Sector enterprises); (ii) Address the lack of specialized and skilful personnel for deploying and operating AI solutions; (iii) Facilitate Access to sustainable funding for innovative AI solutions.\n",
    "At the public policy level, the following actions will be considered: (i) Reforms to the tax policy to promote and encourage innovation; (ii)Policies for Improved access to funding; (iii) Policies for encourage University-Industry interaction.\n",
    "7.2.7 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 7: DEVELOP AI TALENT IN PRIVATE SECTOR \n",
    "As illustrated in ST2, the private sector would greatly benefit from the development of digital skills in AI through training activities that start at school, continue during university education, and are continuously extended during each person's life. It addresses the need for creating soft and technical skills to students, employees, employers, leaders, people with special needs.  Furthermore, AI-related training programs for upskilling and reskilling of employees should be considered, in conjunction with relevant activities of ST2.\n",
    "7.2.8 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 8: REGULATORY/LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR DECISION MAKING BASED ON AI\n",
    "The national legal and regulatory for AI will be a catalyst for AI adoption in the public sector. . It should provide invaluable guidance to private enterprises towards:\n",
    " Establishing clear rules and areas of responsibility of private legal entities.\n",
    " Defining laws and regulations consistent with existing National and European regulations.\n",
    " Training of engineers and researchers on ethical and social challenges.\n",
    " Describing in what way an AI model is auditable.\n",
    "7.2.9 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 9: ATTRACTING FOREIGN PRIVATE INVESTMENTS ON AI \n",
    "Provide incentives for international companies to set up or transfer AI related activities in Greece.

    " Providing financial and tax policy incentives for transferring / setting up their operations in Greece. \n",
    " Provide compelling infrastructure (connectivity, computing) and real estate set up.\n",
    " Promote Greek pool of talent in international employers.\n",
    "7.2.10 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 11: BUILD AI AWARENESS FOR PRIVATE ENTERPRISES COMPANIES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES \n",
    "The penetration of AI-based solutions in the products and operations of stakeholders in key industrial sectors must be facilitates. To achieve this, all the different stages of an awareness building strategy must be covered, such as: \n",
    " Providing a framework for monitoring and analysing AI awareness: This will design and develop an online cataloguing and reporting platform for expressing company status and needs with respect to the usage of AI. Combined with initiatives for informing and interviewing key industry players, the platform will identify the main obstacles, challenges, and concerns of the industry regarding the incorporation of AI in their business and operations, assess and share best practices and developments, provide informative material and the means to connect interested parties with AI experts, etc.\n",
    " Awareness building activities: This item refers to the establishment of an operational framework for organizing a series of workshops, seminars and info-days sponsored and supported by governmental representatives (ministries) in collaboration with academic and research institutions. Thematic orientation should cover all aspects of understanding and using AI in different settings, addressing the needs and capacities of the industry as monitored via the tools described above. \n",
    " Expert-Industry Networking: This will aim to coordinate the bidirectional communication and collaboration of AI experts and industry representatives at the informative and operational levels. It should foresee the organization of information offices towards such activities and a match-making process for information exchange at different levels. On the latter, close collaboration with DIHs for organizing and executing demos and tutorials with sectoral focus is a solution that can be timely implemented and leverage the utility of DIHs for the industry while also aligning their operations with local demands.\n",
    " Offer broad education and training to the general public, employees, and small-medium enterprises, in order to enhance awareness in AI. This can be implemented in conjunction with ST2 activities.\n",

    "8. STRATEGIC TARGET 5 (ST5): AI FOR PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION\n",
    "8.1 CURRENT STATUS - OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\n",
    "8.1.1 INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Public administration will be a main component of the transition from the Industry 4.0 model to the Society 5.0 model, in which people's well-being constitutes the main societal target. According to this model, data are collected by sensors and devices, are accumulated as Big Data, are analysed through AI and ML/DL, and are then implemented, within services to the public, by machines and robots; the latter include Virtual and Augmented Reality devices and materialization through 3-D printing.\n",
    "In Greece, the Ministry of Digital Governance has been recently implementing a rich portfolio of ambitious digital transformation projects, which are at the heart of the country's administrative reform. AI should become a catalyst for accelerating the implementation of some of these projects and for improving the quality of their outcomes. The on-going and accelerated digital transformation of Greece is producing several pillars of the AI ecosystem such as large databases, cloud infrastructures, data centres, and legislative initiatives that foster digitalization. \n",
    "AI can be streamlined with the wider digital strategy of the country, leading to best use of available resources, while taking advantage of the country's significant digital transformation momentum. \n",
    "At European level, the EU strategy on AI was adopted in 2018, whilst in December 2018 the European Commission presented a Coordinated Plan, prepared together with the Member States, to foster the development and use of in Europe, scheduled to run until 2027.  On 19/2/2020, the Commission issued a White Paper 'on Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and trust' aiming to set out policy options towards the twin objective of promoting the uptake of AI and of addressing associated risks. In particular, Action 6 of the White Paper concerns promoting the adoption of AI by the Public Sector, giving priority to healthcare, rural administrations and public service operators, and supporting public procurement of AI systems.  \n",
    "Furthermore, in the recent Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government (at the ministerial meeting of 08/12/2020) the adopted principles include:\n",
    " Social participation and digital inclusion: 'Governments and public authorities should lead by example and provide digital services, which respond to and evolve with citizens' digital preferences; paying tribute to the paradigm shift from \"eGov\" (electronic Government) to \"mGov\" (mobile Government), while encouraging inclusion or aiming to provide seamless, transparent, accessible and user-friendly digital government services. The public sector should encourage wider participation in policy-making by involving society in the design of public services through co-creation, experimentation and collaboration'.\n",
    " Empowerment and digital literacy: 'Citizens and businesses should have seamless and easily accessible interaction with public administration', should be offered 'fair, transparent and user-friendly digital services', 'lifelong learning and development of digital skills', while 'keeping control over their data and its use'.\n",
    " Trust and security in digital government interactions: 'Citizens and businesses should be able to rely on trustworthy and verifiable digital government services, in full conformity with high security standards and responding to user needs', empowered with 'regulatory frameworks that ensure transparency, predictability, security-by-design and, possibly, reinforcement or adjustment of existing provisions.\n",
    " Digital sovereignty and interoperability: 'Common standards, modular architectures and the use of Open-Source Software in the public sector are facilitators for deploying and developing strategic digital tools and capacities', whilst 'software, data and tools generated by the public sector should be reusable and openly accessible as long as this is compliant with fundamental rights', targeting 'creation of a single market for data that will ensure Europe's global competitiveness and data sovereignty'.\n",
    " Human-centred systems and innovative technologies in the public sector: The aim is to promote a human-centred, responsible and common-good oriented development and use of AI and other novel technologies in the public sector', 'ensuring that such applications are inclusive, help solve societal challenges and do not reproduce harmful social or economic biases', while 'being underpinned by a regulatory framework that is sufficiently flexible to mitigate the risks while accelerating innovation and competitiveness'.\n",
    "Furthermore, the adopted policy action areas, in EU Member States by 2024, include 'Creation of value-based, human-centred AI systems for use in the public sector', which:\n",
    " 'fosters responsible, accountable public welfare and human-centred development, and uses transparent, explainable AI, promoting competitiveness and innovation in EU.\n",
    " ensures that necessary safeguards are in place to prevent, detect and remedy unlawful discrimination through the use of AI systems in the public sector.\n",
    " provides effective ICT security tools and requirements to prevent unauthorised access and use, manipulation of data or malicious interference with self-learning algorithms.\n",
    " ensures confidentiality, integrity, and availability of AI systems over the entire life cycle.\n",
    " recognizes the importance of explainable AI, including e.g., adequate transparency at algorithm level, in order to strengthen trustworthiness.\n",
    " ensures proper data governance mechanisms - including appropriate levels of human oversight, if needed, ensuring AI systems' correct functionality and decision-making'.\n",
    "The above principles and the policy action on developing European AI systems for use in the public sector provide the framework for the Greek National Strategy for AI, as far its use in the public sector is concerned.\n",
    "8.1.2 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES\n",
    "'Defining the National Strategy for introduction of AI technologies in Public Administration' is the aim of this section. \n",
    "Achieving this aim will require both the provision, in a coordinated manner, of the necessary data, technologies, systems, regulatory frameworks, as well as the development of appropriate skills and expertise, within the Administration.\n",
    "The following, therefore, constitute the main Objectives of the Strategy:\n",
    "1. Integration of AI in the services provided by Public Administration, while the latter are designed and implemented within the country's National Digital Transformation Reform.\n",
    "2. Development of personalized, user-friendly, transparent AI enabled services, encouraging people's participation through co-creation, experimentation and collaboration.\n",
    "3. Monitoring and Promotion of new AI Technologies in the Public Sector.\n",
    "4. Development of Public Data Repositories, as a basic condition for the development and use of AI/ML technologies in the public sector.\n",
    "5. Promoting and implementing the sharing of data and AI data models among Organizations of the public sector and the wider Community, ensuring re-usability and ability to validate AI models and creating a marketplace for data and models.\n",
    "6. Generation of regulatory and data governance frameworks that ensure robustness, transparency, explainability, fairness and updating/adaptation of AI systems, while offering confidentiality, data protection and security.\n",
    "7. Creation of Digital Skills in the Public Sector in relation to AI.\n",
    "8. Education and building of trust among citizens for using and interacting with AI-enabled public services.\n",
    "9. Increase of public and private expenditures in AI.\n",
    "The first three Objectives refer to technical developments needed for the effective and trusted introduction of AI technologies in the services and interactions with people that are offered by the Public Administration. The following two Objectives refer to the required creation of open public datasets, as well as the sharing of successful AI models among different services provided by the public sector. The sixth Objective sets the need for a regulatory framework to ensure the adoption and safe usage of AI. The following two Objectives refer to the skills, education and trust that are needed to create so as to make feasible AI adoption by the public. The last Objective refers to the need for financial investment in AI developments in the public sector, whilst encouraging and facilitating investments from the private sector; this is shared by all Strategic Targets; it us, therefore, handled at the whole AI Strategy level. \n",
    "8.1.3 OPPORTUNITIES\n",
    "The Ministry of Digital Governance is leading the country's digital transformation, implementing various projects and services offered through the Gov.gr on-line platform. These projects, empowered with the strong and tangible political commitment to digital transformation projects, provide the baseline for developing and introducing AI enabled features in the services provided to the public.  AI can boost efficiency, prediction, monitoring and solution of faults and problems in the everyday operations and service provision of the public sector, particularly in fields such as healthcare, finance, transportations, education and security. \n",
    "Recently, the Code of \"Digital Governance\" (law 4727/2020) has been issued by the Greek Parliament. This provides the institutional and legal basis for the digital transformation of Greece based on a 10-year ahead outlook, whilst it regulates crucial issues in ways that boost the development of AI-related infrastructures, such as open data and cloud-first policies. Together with the Book for Greece Digital Transformation, they provide the framework through which AI transformation of the Public Administration can be achieved.\n",
    "Moreover, many opportunities arise from the recently signed Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government. In particular, the Member States have agreed to:\n",
    " share best practices on the development of successful human-centric AI systems in the public sector,\n",
    " foster transparency and accountability, i.e., by revealing when automated decision-making processes are used in digital public services, and ensure quality standards of data sets fed into AI systems when designing digital public services, e.g., by quality seals for data sets,\n",
    " stimulate knowledge sharing between practitioners of administrative innovation strategies and examples of human centric technologies in public administrations.'\n",
    "They have also agreed to call upon the European Commission and other EU institutions to:\n",
    " continue to monitor the uptake of AI within European public administrations.\n",
    " strengthen digital innovation hubs and AI on demand platform.\n",
    " propose a risk-based, future proof and proportionate legislative proposal on AI and an updated AI coordinated plan, including measures to promote the uptake of trustworthy and human centric AI by public administrations, as appropriate, and assess skills development in public administrations.\n",
    " support research, development and innovation for increasing performance, trustworthiness and uptake of AI-based solutions in the public sector'.\n",
    "The above indicate the strong political support across Europe and all Member States for supporting the AI-enabled transformation of Public Administration, also underlining that the funds provided for digital transformation by the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and by the extraordinary recovery effort \"Next Generation EU (NGEU)\" may have the potential to support, inter alia, the achievement of these common goals and the implementation of these actions. At a National level, it can be mentioned that exploitation of the EU Recovery fund can also be used towards boosting AI research and product development.\n",
    "8.2 MAIN STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS\n",
    "The transition of the Public Sector to the age of AI, characterized by the above Objectives and the related Opportunities, requires generating Action Plans (AP1-AP7) for achieving the following:\n",
    " New types of cross-sectoral management and operation models, in which data and digital resources will generally ignore traditional boundaries between public bodies; the Ministry of Digital Governance should lead the generation of these models in Public Administration, as far as development and use of open data and AI data models is concerned. This is related to Objective 5 of the previous sub-section.\n",
    " Merging, or unifying, various databases of the Public Administration, creating a unique regulated big data market (useful for training AI/ML systems) and a central exchange platform for data, models and systems. This is related to Objective 4 of the previous sub-section.\n",
    " ML systems that are trained in such open public datasets, and AI systems that are based on rules and on interoperable structures and knowledge inserted, or aggregated, in the gov.gr space.  This is related to Objectives 2 and 3 of the previous sub-section.\n",
    " Quick wins and success stories that will increase the citizens' and the public administration's trust on AI. This is related to Objective 1 of the previous sub-section.\n",
    " Building trust with individuals or communities who will be affected by AI systems that assist with decision making. This is related to Objective 8 of the previous sub-section.\n",
    " Critical commitments regarding algorithm impartiality and the protection of fundamental rights, such as privacy rights, by all parties involved, including project contractors, data providers and system operators; paying specific regard to safety and responsibility related to AI-based products and services. This is related to Objective 6 of the previous sub-section.\n",
    " Proper understanding of AI, its capabilities and risks, so that policy makers and civil servants can properly assess its integration into public policy areas. This is related to Objective 7 of the previous sub-section.\n",
    "Moreover, the public sector model in the AI era should be dynamic, in the sense that it should be continuously informed about developments in AI technologies (e.g., architectures and paradigms, offering improved technical performance), trustworthy AI (e.g., guidelines, best practices and standards for complying with the mandates of the HLEG), as well as architectures and oversight mechanisms for Safe, Secure and Privacy-Preserving AI.\n",
    "To achieve the generation of a public sector model, with all the above characteristics, the following strategic directions will be considered by the Greek state as part of the implementation of the National AI strategy.\n",
    "8.2.1 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 1: AI PUBLIC SECTOR GOVERNANCE\n",
    "AI Public Sector governance should be able to monitor the progress of Action Plans AP1-AP7 described above and inform the Ministry of Digital Governance on any required changes or new directions to be adopted, especially related to new developments D1-D3. Specific sub-actions that should be implemented are the following:\n",
    " Monitoring AI Activities in the Scope of the National AI Generation: An infrastructure for monitoring public sector activities should be generated inside the Hellenic AI Observatory. It will assist the Ministry of Digital Governance to follow the continuously advancing AI field, to design appropriate changes and develop future plans and directions. It will also monitor KPIs about the progress, the success, and the operations of AI projects. Such KPIs will include accomplishments, links to data, computing infrastructures, AI experts, AI projects, GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth, AI-related investments. \n",
    " Monitoring and Assess the Trustworthiness of Public Sector System as part of the National Committee for Technoethics and Bioethics and its AI Auditing Body function: The National Committee for Technoethics and Bioethics, will audit the development of AI systems for the public sector in a structured a and consistent way. In particular, the National Committee for Technoethics and Bioethics shall provide ethical and trustworthiness requirements for AI systems in the public sector. It will be also in charge of auditing the trustworthiness of proposed, or developed AI systems, as well as their compliance with the relevant ethical, legal, and democratic principles.\n",
    " Public Sector AI Platform - Documentation of AI Resources in the National AI Marketplace: A platform will be generated, which will contribute horizontally to all projects and applications of AI and ML/DL, ensuring availability and use of reliable components, such as training datasets and algorithm libraries, and evaluation based on reliable evaluation test datasets. The platform will be linked to computing infrastructures at affordable terms, ensuring the aggregation of appropriate data from each sector, as well as the development and sharing of algorithms in the public sector. It will lead to the data and AI models that will be shared through the National AI Marketplace. \n",
    " Fertile Community Generation: A fertile community will be created, consisting of specialized engineers and specialists in each application domain coming from both the state sector and private enterprises, with mutually beneficial collaborations around the triangle \"Research community, Public and Business\". It will result in creating a framework of accountability and responsibility between the actors that will develop AI/ML systems and applications, so that they operate for the benefit of environmental and social well-being. \n",
    "8.2.2 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 2: DEVELOP AI REFERENCE PROJECTS AND SUCCESS STORIES\n",
    "A main target is the introduction of AI in government provided services, especially related to gov.gr, so as to facilitate citizens' interactions with the public sector. AI can assist citizens addressing queries to the appropriate service within gov.gr, completing forms, finding documents, scheduling appointments. AI can assist in understanding and appropriately answering citizen's inquiries and feedback.\n",
    "In this direction mechanisms should be established for identifying and implementing reference projects. The latter will serve as showcases of AI in the public sector and will provide insights and experience for wider deployment and use. Likewise, they will serve as success stories that can foster adoption of AI-enabled services by citizens and public sector employees.\n",
    "Indicative examples of reference projects for the public administration are listed in the following sub-paragraphs.\n",
    "8.2.2.1 ANOMALY DETECTION IN PUBLIC OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS\n",
    "This includes:\n",
    " Development of AI applications against tax evasion, for faster and more effective tax collection, for tax surveillance and compliance applications.\n",
    " Development of AI/ML applications for detecting incidents of fuel and petroleum smuggling.\n",

    " Generation of public healthcare data repositories, including genomics data and the development of systems for assisting early stage, safe and trusted prediction of diseases.\n",
    " DL models pretrained on Greek corpora, available for use on public infrastructures.\n",
    "8.2.2.4 DEVELOPMENT OF REFERENCE AI PROJECTS\n",
    "Specific projects to start with can be the following:\n",
    " Employment of AI to enhance the information search capabilities of the Diavgeia platform, from the already existing data; enhancing the Diavgeia platform with metadata so that it will facilitate leveraging the Diavgeia material from now on. The project should leverage and extend the capabilities of the \"Diavgeia Semantic information search and knowledge retrieval platform\" which is described in Greece's \"Digital Book\". This platform will include intelligent and configurable applications for automatic indexing, processing and discovery of knowledge using AI / NLP and semantic web technologies.\n",
    " Employment of AI/NLP techniques to enhance the user experience in the gov.gr portal (e.g., identifying navigation paths, re-organizing information on access patterns, providing suggestions for searches and actions).\n",
    " Introduction of chatbots in the front office of the public administration towards improving customer service and saving human resources that could be reallocated to other tasks.\n",
    " Leveraging, in a privacy-preserving manner, the solemn declarations and powers of attorney to identify processes that could be improved, automated, or eliminated in the public sector.\n",
    " Reference projects for the Ministry of Labour (e.g., AI Extensions to the BI programs of Rebrain Greece) and the Ministry of Justice (e.g., NLP projects for the automated transcription of court records).\n",
    "In addition to reference projects defined by the government, AI actors of the private sector will be also invited to participate to competitive calls-for-reference AI projects i.e., to propose reference projects for the public sector. \n",
    "8.2.3 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 3: REFORMING THE PUBLIC SECTOR WITH AI \n",
    "New types of cross-sectoral management and operation models will be generated, in which data and digital resources will generally ignore traditional boundaries between public bodies. AI-based public sector reform will consider the following aspects:\n",
    "8.2.3.1 INFRASTRUCTURES IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR \n",
    "In conjunction with the activities for establishing the national AI infrastructures (see ST1) the prerequisite infrastructures for AI deployment in the public sector should be generated. These will include open datasets and databases for training and testing algorithms, and computing infrastructures for deploying and operating computationally intensive AI applications (e.g., DL, Reinforcement Learning, RL, algorithms). In this framework, access to data and computing resources for AI-based innovation in the public sector should be enabled through the G-Cloud, H-Cloud and RE-Cloud infrastructures; large scale governmental databases should be hosted and managed in these infrastructures. \n",
    "8.2.3.2 ATTRACTING AI TALENT IN THE SCOPE OF INNOVATIVE PROJECTS\n",
    "Given the rapid evolution of AI technologies it is important to ensure that AI knowledge and innovation are regularly injected within public sector organizations. To this end, mechanisms for transferring AI knowledge and talent from the research, academic and private to the public sector should be established. This can be achieved by organizing competitive programs for innovation development in the public sector, such as hackathons or innovation contests.\n",
    "8.2.3.3 EMPOWERING IT TEAMS OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION TO IMPLEMENT AI PROJECTS\n",
    "The implementation of ambitious AI-related public administration projects requires strong IT teams within public sector organizations. Greece should ensure that AI-competent professionals' team up for the implementation of AI projects, within the workforce of key structures and public organizations like the Ministry of Digital Governance. This can include the creation of an AI Sandbox - testing and experimentation environment for public administrations to test and implement ambitious AI projects. This would be consistent with the AI platform that was described above.\n",
    "8.2.3.4 RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND SUPPORT\n",
    "AI algorithms can be used to efficiently cope with large datasets, to assign employees to complex tasks, to optimize the use of resources, to organize space and time in optimal ways. In case there is a lack of specialized people, AI algorithms can be used to support decision making and addressing repetitive tasks.\n",
    "8.2.3.5 INTRODUCTION OF ROBOTIC PROCESS AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGIES\n",
    "With the aim to reduce repetitive administrative tasks, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a business process automation technology that enables the automation of repetitive manual tasks that rely heavily on rules. The goal is to introduce RPA systems that will help public organizations save time and money by automating manual and repetitive tasks, improving accuracy and reducing the risk of human error. By using them, employees can focus on higher value tasks, automating repetitive tasks, while significant money savings can be achieved by extending the lifespan of older (legacy) information systems.\n",
    "8.2.4 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 4: GENERATING DIGITAL SKILLS FOR AI \n",
    "One of the main strategic directions of ST2 involves the training of public sector employees. As part of the planned ST2 activities, the following directions should be considered:\n",
    "8.2.4.1 DIGITAL ABILITIES AND SKILLS FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS\n",
    "Public servants should become equipped with the skills needed to understand and use AI systems. In this direction, reference courses and training programs should be planned to provide basic knowledge about AI and its use in the public sector, including information on reference projects. In addition, the need to develop and provide e-services to citizens and businesses increases the demand for executives with a higher level of skills related to AI services offered by the Public Sector in the future. \n",
    "To reinforce these activities, the Ministry of Digital Governance needs to cooperate with all public administration organizations for coordination of actions, implementation of projects, provision of know-how, provision of materials and intangible resources, securing funding, conducting studies and horizontal provision of strategic directions and monitoring. Such organizations include the Ministries of Education, Labour & Social Affairs, Development and Investment, Rural Development as well as their supervised Organizations. Synergies should be also implemented with respective educational, research, professional bodies, social partners and natural persons who have distinguished themselves with their initiatives in digital technologies.\n",
    "8.2.4.2 COLLABORATION PLATFORM\n",
    "A basic condition for the substantial upgrade of digital skills related to AI in the Public Sector is the cooperation with the Ministry of Interior Affairs and with EKDDA, as a strategic training body for civil servants and employees of the Local Authorities, as well as with other respective educational institutions in the public and private sector. Through this cooperation, the education and training of public sector employees and executives is sought to be in line with the planned National Digital Skills Framework, which will be harmonized with the respective European Digital Capacity Framework (DigComp) system in conjunction with the DigComputer system. professions (ESCO). \n",
    "The platform of the Digital Academy of Citizens can be the central coordination hub of all digital skills development, with the aim of wide-ranging digital actions for the acquisition of digital skills by the public sector, as well as the entire population. More specifically, it can act as a \"Collaboration Platform\" of digital education providers by coordinating, through a homogeneous national business logic, the action plan for the acquisition of digital skills related to AI, at basic, intermediate and advanced levels. \n",
    "8.2.5 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 5:  AI AS A TECHNOLOGY ELEMENT IN PUBLIC SECTOR ACTIVITIES\n",
    "AI can form the basic technology element for making public sector activities effective and efficient. The following aspects will be considered:\n",
    "8.2.5.1 PUBLIC PROCUREMENT \n",
    "The government should have clear specifications about when an automation should be considered as AI, and thus the system comes under the monitoring of the Observatory and needs to satisfy AI-specific requirements for responsible, explainable, and auditable applications of AI.\n",
    "8.2.5.2 FOSTERING PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS\n",
    "Public private partnerships can be beneficial in the case of large-scale flagship projects. Such partnerships could serve as basis for enhancing existing projects with AI capabilities or for defining new projects in areas of top priority for the public sector, such as the development of AI centres and HPC data centres for use by public and private sector enterprises, and the scaling up of reference projects (e.g., chatbots for front office) based on public-private partnerships.\n",
    "8.2.6 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 6:  AI FOR GENERATING SMART AND SAFE PUBLIC ENVIRONMENTS\n",
    "AI can be the basis for ensuring operation of public environments in smart and safe modes. The following directions will be considered:\n",
    "8.2.6.1 ENCOURAGING AI DEPLOYMENTS IN SMART CITIES\n",
    "Supporting Greek (smart) cities in their efforts to become playgrounds for AI applications and to boost innovation based on advanced AI technologies should be targeted. The support could be provided based on funding programs, support in infrastructure development, as well as training and education programs. Actions could include organizing public tenders to select the top (e.g., top 3) most innovative cities based on AI; supporting the development of lighthouse AI projects (e.g., autonomous driving) in selected cities; supporting cities in the development of their AI related infrastructures (e.g., 5G, IoT, computing etc.).\n",
    "8.2.6.2  ADDRESSING THE OVERARCHING CLIMATE CRISIS\n",
    "AI can assist in achieving reduction of food waste, as well as of generated CO2, reduction and better management of water and energy usage, ensuring efficiency and safety in the 'farm to fork' food production and supply chain. Therefore, it can greatly assist the evolution of the Green economy in the country.\n",
    "8.2.6.3 RISK AND ANOMALY PREDICTION RELATED TO CIVIL PROTECTION\n",
    "The aim is to create ML systems that will be trained and powered by public data and will be able to predict the daily probability of different types of hazards, such as floods, cyclones, fires and road accidents. The systems will be able to calculate based on these probabilities the needs of each competent service in human and material resources and to propose optimized response plans. Moreover, building arbitrariness systems in forest areas and the coastal system that will use DL algorithms to detect building violations in protected areas, forests, and shores.\n",

    "9. STRATEGIC TARGET 6 (ST6): ETHICAL, TRUSTWORTHY AND DEMOCRATIC AI FOR ALL\n",
    "9.1 CURRENT STATUS - CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES\n",
    "9.1.1 INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Discussions on the risks posed by artificial intelligence systems range from current concerns, such as violations of privacy, threats to individuals' autonomy/authority, and harmful effects on society, to debates about whether machines could ever escape from human control. For example, AI technologies can tremendously benefit health care but at the same time raise several questions about whether the opacity of machine learning-based decisions weakens the authority of clinicians, threatens patients' autonomy, or jeopardises decision-making between doctor and patient.\n",
    "For this reason, the regulation of AI concerning all aspects of applications in real life settings dictate careful governance and regulatory mechanisms adopting a risk-based approach. AI should be considered as a way to improve human performance and generate added value in humanity through synergistic paradigms as for example the notion of Augmented intelligence. \n",
    "Although fully predicting the consequences of these technological developments is not possible, the need for thoughtful governance is evident. By applying our human intelligence, we can steer the development, uses, and impact of artificial intelligence in ways that accord with human values, increasing the benefits and mitigating the risks.\n",
    "According to the European Commission's High-level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) [HLEG19a] (p. 5) three components related to trustworthiness are proposed, that should be considered/applied during the entire lifecycle of an AI solution: (1) Lawful, the compliance to laws and regulations; (2) Ethical, the adherence to ethical principles and moral values and (3) Robust, \"both from a technical and social perspective\" [HLEG19a]. In line with the same ethics guidelines, a holistic approach must be followed based on the harmonious and synergetic application of all three components on a) the AI technology and its inherent properties; b) to the actors behind development, deployment and use of an AI solution; and c) the AI solution's \"socio-technical context throughout its entire life cycle\" [HLEG19a].\n",
    "Besides the legal framework, the HLEG places ethics, moral values, technical robustness and robustness from a societal perspective to the forefront, as essential components for enhancing trust. Implementing these components is strongly tied to adhering to democratic principles and application of democratic processes. As members of a society, humans may be equipped with a \"moral compass\", guided by morality and our common ethical and moral values. However, historical evidence suggests that \"some of our deepest and most intractable disputes are not about values or principles\", \"but about the world to which these principles apply\" [Gaus16]. Suggesting that while we often agree on principles, \"the differences lie in the social worlds to which we apply these values and principles: the way we interpret what we see around us\" [Deloitte20]. For example, while there might be consensus on principles, i.e., that AI solutions should be ethical, fair and cause no harm, there may be disagreements on how to enact on these principles, and how these principles can be practically applied [Deloitte20]. One of the most powerful tools we have in order to resolve such disputes is democracy. Therefore, democratisation of AI may be proved a valuable component for achieving ethicalness and robustness under a societal context.\n",
    "9.1.2 AIM AND OBJECTIVES \n",
    "The aim of this strategic target is to foster ethical, trustworthy, responsible, and democratic AI, respecting the rights, freedoms, democratic values and welfare of humans and nature at all times; to place AI technology at the service of people, society and the environment based on values that we share. Values that should guide the ongoing evolution of AI, safeguarding the wellbeing of humans and nature, while protecting human autonomy and freedom. Values that go beyond AI regulation and which we need to co-design with Ethos-in-AI acting as a moral code for AI. \n",
    "Towards this aim, this effort encompasses AI systems, humans, and the natural environment and has the following objectives that are in accordance with the principles of the Berlin Declaration. \n",
    "9.1.3 OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES \n",
    "The key opportunities for Greece can be summarised, as follows: \n",
    " Emphasis on ethical, legal, trustworthy AI at a European level as well as among like-minded countries and relevant initiatives.\n",
    " Democratic values are seen, at an international level, as the common ground that unites countries across the world and upon which solid AI principles can be created. \n",
    " Moving from principles to practice. At the moment the global spotlight is on the operationalisation of the Ethical Principles for Trustworthy AI into practical, actionable frameworks and tools to facilitate this transition. \n",
    " Need for participatory social shaping of technology in a democratised way. AI-driven innovation and digital transformation should be driven in collaboration with citizens and all relevant stakeholders, in an inclusive and participatory way and under a democratised approach. This ascertains the effective adoption of appropriate and efficient, human-centric systems, boosting the impact of innovation horizontally across domains of application.\n",
    " Need for an AI audit system. There is a need not only to create but also to practice the highest level of standards for ethical, trustworthy, democratic AI across the private and the public sector. In this way, the rights, freedoms and our shared values will be safeguarded.\n",
    " Greece offers a unique setting to identify the intricacies of human-centric, ethical AI research, development and application. This fact stems from the geographic position of Greece and the related population influx that has occurred for several years. This mosaic of cultures, values and ethical bases make Greece an ideal place to develop the processes for mutual understanding and co-creation of AI, which can then be transferred to the wider, multilingual, multi-cultural EU environment.\n",
    " Since AI can and should be developed in a democratic manner, through sustainable democratic processes, Greece can utilise its strong conceptual connection to Democracy to fulfil this requirement. This connection also offers a unique opportunity for branding Greece as the birthplace of Democracy 2.0, in essence and in action. Such awareness will facilitate the communication and the dissemination of the related know-how that will be developed, creating a unique position for Greece in the global AI spectrum.\n",
    " Greece has a unique, post-crisis setting -through two consecutive crises- which pushes for innovation across all domains of activity. Democratisation is the way to ascertain that this innovation, and the socio-economic and cultural structures that will emerge from this, remain aligned to the EU value system, while empowering financial development. This empowerment will be facilitated if \"AI made in Greece\" is directly connected to trustworthy, human-centric, ethics-by-design, democratically co-created AI, which creates a unique selling proposition in itself.\n",
    "9.1.4 CHALLENGES TO OVERCOME\n",
    "Enhancing the adoption of AI and harnessing its full potential for the benefit of all, necessitates that we address several challenges. \n",
    " Trust-related challenges. These challenges may be caused by ambiguity or lack of information and incomplete knowledge around AI. This can diminish the benefits of technology for people, and reduce industry's involvement in AI driven innovation taking into account their customers perception and potential engagement with AI apps, data sharing practices, etc. Building trust in AI and creating the necessary conditions (e.g., protection of data, rights, freedoms and values as well as the processes that will enable transparent, explainable and accountable AI innovation) is a prerequisite.  \n",
    " Address potential negative AI challenges. Although AI holds a great economic, social, and environmental promise, there are potential negative AI challenges that we need to address. These challenges include ethical, social, democratic, legal and regulatory ones. Understanding and addressing these challenges is a critical aspect. \n",
    " Ensuring fundamental-rights, freedoms and democratic values are protected at all times. The ability of AI to realise its full potential, depends on the way that we will choose to seize this opportunity and address the challenges that relate among others to the protection of the fundamental rights, the freedoms and democratic values. \n",
    " Legal challenges. Some indicative challenges in this are the proliferation of laws, regulations, guidelines and principles. The lack of communication between regulators and makers. The inability to keep pace with the technological pace. Therefore, ensuring appropriate legal frameworks is a key requirement for the trustworthy, responsible and democratic AI adoption and use. \n",
    " Inclusiveness challenges. Inclusiveness in this context includes making AI systems accessible to all citizens, while also supporting AI systems for vulnerable groups such as people with disabilities. Moreover, inclusiveness should capture gender aspects and ensure that Women have adequate access to the development, deployment, operation and use of AI systems.\n",
    "9.2 MAIN STRATEGIC DIRECTIONS\n",
    "9.2.1 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 1: DEVELOPMENT OF A LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR ETHICAL AND DEMOCRATIC AI\n",
    "Having already signed up for the digital transformation with recently introduced regulatory instruments like the Book of Digital Transformation and L.4727/2020 on Digital Governance, Greece understands that traditional notions of law, practices and the underlying technical architecture need to be transferred to the digital. Such a shift requires a bold but realistic refinement of the regulatory framework on AI and related technologies. To reach a satisfactory boldness/realism ratio, Greece needs to unpack and explore AI, ethics and the law as a complex system and create an informed AI regulatory landscape, designed through agile navigation among inherent tensions (i.e., privacy vs. free flow of data, ownership vs. control, quality vs volume, ethics centric vs. human rights centric). Such unpacking does not necessarily imply a new regulatory framework, rather a collective understanding of the core values the Greek society seeks to optimise and the operational bearings thereof. It does not require a monotonous hook to legal concepts 'as is', rather a rational adaptation.\n",
    "Nowadays we are witnessing, at European level, basic regulatory building blocks making their way to the field or reserving a seat in the pipeline. These blocks attempt to reflect the reposition of values in the AI and wider information structures. Referencing the European approach, Greece will focus on modelling the ethical and democratic AI design. As part of the ST6 pillar of the strategy a holistic approach will be targeted, addressing activities that range from philosophical engineering to ethical filtering to targeted rulemaking through a set of measured action items that aim at generating practical outcomes of added value. As such, the regulatory focus should initially identify qualities and principles and then shift to testing, implementation, -auditing and further refinement. This virtuous cycle will allow Greece to elaborate on pressing issues and to identify the proper performative elements for its safe AI future. The following aspects shall be considered.\n",
    "9.2.1.1 CREATE AN INFORMED AI REGULATORY FRAMEWORK\n",
    "Establish a cluster of interdisciplinary working groups, each one focused on different thematic areas but with democratic values at the very core. The working groups shall form a network of collaboration and the primary objective shall be to: a) map and catalogue laws and their inherent guiding principles and values per thematic domain, sector or selected systems; b) interpret the identified framework per thematic domain and benchmark the existing -system- requirements (b1) against the emerging -system- requirements, following the AI transition (b2); c) identify unregulated areas and blind spots; d) identify legal updates/revisions or new legislation and ensure they fit for purpose; e) identify the implications for researchers, developers and manufacturers, deployers, operators and users of AI services and products thereof; f) identify whether such updates/revisions are genuinely necessary according to the emerging requirements of the thematic domain, sector  or selected system in question; g) shape the requirements accordingly; h) configure the limitations imposed by 'heavy' legal concepts like intellectual property, data protection and privacy according to the set requirements by introducing proper derogations and/or bold modifications.\n",
    "An umbrella committee of the AI Politeia will collaborate with the National Committee for Technoethics and Bioethics towards: a) harvesting all findings and insights, b) articulating the impact of AI on the democratic standards defined by the AI Politeia and vice versa, c) reporting, d) providing targeted recommendations on guidelines, soft law practices and further calibrations on legal requirements, ethical principles in line with the identified democratic standards. The Hellenic AI Supervising Committee will open communication channels with the AI Dialogues Platform and extract inputs from the Ethical and Democratic AI Toolkit, which are both described in following paragraphs. \n",
    "The primary output shall be an applicable democracy framework relevant to the AI reality and to the priorities of the country. At a second stage, the interdisciplinary working group input and the AI Supervising Committee output will blend in a circular mode to:\n",
    " Operationalise the identified guiding principles and values in AI models by introducing metrics, benchmarks, thresholds etc so as to ensure quality and actualisation in a safe fashion;\n",
    " Research and develop hands on AI solutions and simulations for maximum legal and regulatory enforcement in context (explainability, transparency, auditability, non-maleficence, non-bias, inclusion and participation);\n",
    " Design, introduce and apply participatory and democratic oversight procedures at large in collaboration with the National Committee for Technoethics and Bioethics and any relevant sub-committees of the AI Politeia; this includes the AI architecture choices and the algorithmic appropriations;\n",
    " Foster the appropriate regulatory framework for AI driven decisions, products and services;\n",
    " Align with and actualise the Berlin Declaration on Digital Society with emphasis on democratic design. \n",
    "9.2.1.2 EMBED LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND ETHICAL PRINCIPLES IN THE NATIONAL AI INFRASTRUCTURES (IN LINE WITH ST1)\n",
    "The emerging properties of the new (fair) data economy must be identified, while the actualisation of the Data Governance Act Proposal must be thoroughly explored. Focus on the 'how' to use and re-use (i.e., sharing mechanisms, interoperability, standards, governance) for the public benefit, financial growth and societal well-being. Ensure high value data and fit for purpose open/close mergers. Enhance collaboration and data sharing between asymmetric partners. The Book of Digital Transformation (sections 5 and 6) provides an appropriate formalistic framework towards the above ends.\n",
    " Consider contributing to relative projects of international interest from abroad (e.g., the IHAN project, among others) and support international bilateral or multilateral synergies on selected regulatory grounds.\n",
    " Consider updates/revisions to critical legal frameworks to: a) calibrate data generation and sharing with emphasis on text and data mining permissions for training model purposes; b) ensure provenance and traceability for minimum distortion; c) follow the algorithmic chain for maximum transparency and roles/liability tracking (including automated decision making). \n",
    " Test-bed training data, models and algorithms within appropriate sandboxes. \n",
    " Design and test risk assessment mechanisms for the use of personal data and anonymous data within the data governance framework. \n",
    " Identify generic and custom quality standards and safety measures. \n",
    " Define the AI commons; Design a set of normative reciprocity appropriations, collective management tools and governance models. Streamline AI commons with Open Science framework regarding data, ML models and infrastructures, so as to ensure maximum value creation while respecting the governance of the commons and avoid enclosure and value capture when not part of the game. \n",
    " Identify the role of tech giants in the AI commons production, enclosure and capture and regulate accordingly.\n",
    " Ensure the maximum adoption of the Open Source Software Strategy 2020-2023 of the Commission.\n",
    " Deploy an extended actualisation and enforcement plan regarding L.4577/2018 for network and information security (the NIS law).\n",
    "9.2.1.3 FRAMEWORK INTERVENTIONS IN AI RESEARCH, EDUCATION & SKILL CAPITAL \n",
    "The legal and regulatory framework should be supported by the development of proper talent on AI, as outlined in ST2. In this direction, education and training activities must account for providing the expertise necessary for developing, supporting, and using Greece's Democratic AI paradigm. Multi-disciplinary training programs combining technology, ethics, economic and legal aspects, among others, is a key to this end.  \n",
    "9.2.2 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 2: NATIONAL AI AUDITING  \n",
    "As illustrated in the governance scheme of the Strategy, the National Committee for Technoethics and Bioethics will serve as a National AI Auditing Body. As part of its AI Auditing role, the Committee will provide the requirements and auditing frameworks for AI systems regarding trustworthiness and accountability, while assessing their compliance with the necessary ethical, democratic, and legal principles. It will act as the national advisory committee on the development and implementation of artificial intelligence and will provide the required mechanisms to establish broad policy and legal principles for AI. The government can receive advice from this body on ways to optimize the development of AI, to support the unbiased development and application AI, and to protect the fundamental rights, freedoms, and democratic values. \n",
    "An AI Auditing Framework will be developed to support the work of the National Committee for Technoethics and Bioethics, when assessing the compliance of developing, testing, and deploying AI systems (AI lifecycle) across different application areas and industrial domains. It will consider existing efforts in the area that focus on the practical implementation of ethical guidelines (i.e., the AI HLEG Assessment list for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI, 2020)), data compliance of AI systems (i.e., the AI Auditing Framework (ICO, 2019)), and the model process for addressing ethical concerns during system design (IEEE P7000 standards), among others.  A necessary part of this framework will be the compilation of AI related terminology and its definitions (e.g., what may be considered as automated weaponry) thus clarifying what technologies should be watched over by the National Committee of Technoethics and Bioethics. The creation of such a glossary would have the added value of ensuring the translation and coining of foreign AI related jargon in Greek and vice versa. Additionally, the AI Auditing Framework will contain general heuristics and guidelines regarding the AI ethical auditing procedure of AI technologies and organisations employing them.\n",
    "The National Committee for Technoethics and Bioethics will provide \"AI Certifications\" to public and private sector AI projects, tools, systems, and services aiming to foster trust and promote responsible, ethical, trustworthy and democratic AI innovation. The National Committee for Technoethics and Bioethics will conduct frequent impact assessment studies of the AI audits, in order to identify the impact on competitiveness as well as on social trustworthiness.\n",
    "Moreover, to ensure and maintain the democratisation of AI, the National Committee for Technoethics and Bioethics should be in close contact with citizens through public outreach programs, public discussions and debates, and the release of policy papers for public consultation. This can be achieved through the \"AI Dialogues\" platform and will help assure that citizens are in the loop of AI development and that regulators and technologists alike receive feedback from the public, safeguarding and preserving democratic AI.\n",
    "9.2.3 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 3: LEAD EFFORT FOR AN EU LABEL FOR ETHICAL AND DEMOCRATIC AI\n",
    "The operationalisation of ethically sound and democratic AI applications can involve the social co-creation (with citizens, researcher and academia, private and public sector) of an 'Ethical and Democratic AI Label'. This voluntary label will act as a competitive advantage for the companies that are concerned with the 'social AI footprint' and want to denote their support for ethical and Democratic AI, conveying the right trust assurances to their customers. \n",
    "The label could be based on an index that will rate and classify AI systems, tools and applications based on their AI ethical and democratic level (following the example of the EU Energy Label). It could take into account, in addition to the legal, ethical and democratic AI components, the contextual parameters, such as the application context (business-to-business, business-to-consumer, etc), the sector (industrial context) and the associate risk, following a risk-based approach. It will have distinct acceptance levels (minimum requirements) depending on the AI domain (high and low risk domain), the AI application context and the current and potential (future) use of the system. \n",
    "The National Committee for Technoethics and Bioethics will also ensure the implementation of the 'Ethical and Democratic AI Label', which will be standardized at EU level, in collaboration with all EU countries. Greece aims to lay the foundations for such a standardization that could springboard from Greece to the world. \n",
    "9.2.4 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 4: ESTABLISHING A THINK TANK WITHIN THE AI POLITEIA \n",
    "Establish a think tank for ethical and democratic AI as a national, independent initiative. It could act as an open, multi-disciplinary thought leadership body that will foster a co-creation environment and establish a global dialogue around AI, how to attain Trustworthy and Democratic AI, respecting the rights and welfare of humans and nature. Recognizing the importance and the potential of AI, as well as the possible challenges and risks, the potential implications for society (impact on human rights, people's lives and our democratic values) and the natural environment the AI Politeia will aim to foster a value-driven technology-enabled future that embraces responsible AI innovation for the benefit of all and for the shared common good. \n",
    "9.2.5 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 5: GENERAL AI AWARENESS\n",
    "In the scope of public campaigns to foster awareness (see ST2), trust and democratisation of AI must be emphasized. The following directions will be considered and pursued.\n",
    "9.2.5.1 ESTABLISHMENT OF AN \"AI DIALOGUES\" PLATFORM\n",
    "This platform could be part of the National Digital Academy and will include a public feedback system where individuals could provide their feedback in relation to specific ethical issues, AI regulations, issues related to transparency and trustworthiness, etc to trigger discussions and active AI dialogue. To ensure an inclusive and equal representation of all civil society segments, including minorities, non-technology savvy individuals, and vulnerable members of our society, specialised physical workshops could be conducted, either by inviting members of these communities and/or via representative organisations (NGOs, researchers, experts, etc) that can provide the views of these community members. The activity will be linked to the think tank of the AI Politeia as well.\n",
    "9.2.5.2 AI DEMOCRATISATION BAROMETER\n",
    "An 'AI Democratisation Barometer' will be designed and deployed as part of the Hellenic AI Observatory. Its mission will be to measure AI Democratisation performance at a national level (at an initial stage) and at an international scale (at a latter stage). A special index will be created that will measure the characteristics of AI Democratisation across counties in order to facilitate the comparative analyses and benchmark countries commitment towards responsible, trustworthy and democratized AI innovation. Moreover, dedicated experts' workshops will be conducted and scoring exercises could be designed to co-define the key AI Democratisation parameters and assess their scoring potential, aiming to produce a collective intelligence index.\n",
    "9.2.6 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 6: AI LITERACY PROJECT IN THE NATIONAL DIGITAL ACADEMY\n",
    "This National AI Literacy Project will be part of the National Digital Academy and will focus on breaking the AI knowledge barrier for civil society. This project will democratise AI knowledge by opening cross-thematic AI knowledge and facilitating knowledge-acquisition for all societal segments. This entails initially the provision of relevant AI knowledge (open knowledge) to all civil society segments, acknowledging the specific needs of each community group and the needs of the vulnerable members of our society. \n",
    "Dedicated AI courses and training material will be created, addressing for all stakeholder groups via educational curricula and public awareness activities for AI, and the envisioned societal, legal and ethical impact of AI. These courses will be developed in collaboration with the academic community and prominent European and International initiatives (Elements of AI, etc). Another crucial component of AI knowledge democratisation is the nurturing of an inclusive, constructive, on-going AI- dialogue (e.g., via structured public consultations, hands-on challenges, and gamified approaches) that will amplify existing knowledge, infuse society with new insights and facilitate the co-creation of shared values, ethical principles, policies, standards, among others. Towards this aim specialised strategic actions have been included. \n",
    "9.2.7 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 7: ESTABLISH A SANDBOX FOR TRUSTWORTHY AND DEMOCRATIC AI\n",
    "This unique AI sandbox will facilitate experimentation with all aspects (i.e., technological, ethical, regulatory) of Greece's democratic AI paradigm It will enable researchers, practitioners, policy makers and legal and regulatory auditors to experiment and test novel technical and non-technical propositions, AI solutions and AI governance frameworks that will foster a value-driven and responsible approach to AI innovation across sectors.  The Sandbox will be part of the national testbeds and experimentation infrastructures presented in ST1 and ST3, possibly co-located or established jointly with them in an attempt to streamline costs and maximize value for money.\n",
    "9.2.8 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 8: PROVIDE AN ETHICAL AND DEMOCRATIC AI TOOLKIT\n",
    "Support the design and creation of a unique collection of tools i.e., a 'Ethical and Democratic AI toolkit', that will support the ethical and democratic deployment of AI across sectors and communities. The toolkit will facilitate the operationalisation of the democratic AI principles (i.e., democratic ethos in AI by design) that will complement the European guidelines for trustworthy AI (HLEG principles/guidelines), OECD's ethical frameworks and will be in direct alignment with the Berlin Declaration on Digital Society 2020. \n",
    "This AI toolkit will aim to reduce bias and discrimination, while enhancing the ethical and responsible use of AI, infused with the values, principles and moral ideals of democracy so as to serve as an example of a good practice in the EU and globally. It will include online self-assessment tools that will be developed in multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research context, utilising the AI democratisation sandbox and tested in AI pilot projects across-sectors (i.e., existing and upcoming AI projects). Different versions of the toolkit could be formed focusing on the needs of the: (a) public sector, (b) private sector, (c) research and academia. \n",
    "9.2.9 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 9: AI FOR GREEN TRANSFORMATION & SUSTAINABLE FUTURE \n",
    "As our societies move towards a post-pandemic (COVID-19) recovery, it is important according to the United Nations (UN) to \"build back better\" by creating more sustainable, resilient and inclusive societies. In this context, AI technologies should benefit society and the natural environment in a sustainable way. Green AI can be seen not only as a way of using AI in a more sustainable way but also as a way of using AI to solve the sustainability challenges. Hence, there is a need for actions that will focus on the use of AI for contributing to sustainability challenges. Such actions will complement Green AI activities outlined in ST1.\n",
    "Emphasis should be placed on using AI to boost the Environment Performance in Various Sectors as well as on the development of business cases and showcases regarding the use of AI for improving environmental performance in areas like manufacturing and the circular economy.\n",
    "9.2.10 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 10: DEVELOP ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES FOR TRUSTWORTHY AND EXPLAINABLE AI\n",
    "Developers and researchers will be encouraged to consider trustworthiness aspects during the design and development of AI systems. For this purpose, it is critical to invest in multi-and-cross-disciplinary AI research that aims at resolving key issues related to the social impact of AI, such as fairness, transparency, explainability and value alignment, with the underlying focus on building trustworthy AI, that is beneficial to people and the planet and aligned to our shared European values of democracy, personal freedom, human dignity, solidarity, active civil society, market economy and rule of law. \n",
    "In practice, this objective can be achieved by channelling funding to research aspects associated with the various dimensions of trustworthiness, such as fairness, transparency, explainability, and the elimination of bias and discrimination in the algorithms' results. Explainable AI, and the development of appropriate methodologies to measure fairness, bias and discriminatory aspects must be explicitly funded, to encourage research on the subject. This research effort can be conducted in partnership with related initiatives, such as the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) among others. \n",
    "9.2.11 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 11: PROACTIVELY DEVELOP PLANS AND POLICIES FOR THE FUTURE OF WORK \n",
    "Digitalization and globalization have sparked radical shifts in how we live and work. While no one knows what artificial intelligence's effect on work will exactly be, one thing is certain: it is disruptive. So far, many have cast that disruption in a negative light and projected a future in which AI takes jobs from human workers. Questions about how AI will affect the workplace are already pressing in many sectors. However, many concerns raised about AI are similar to ones from previous periods of rapid change, like the Industrial Revolution. Another perspective is that automation may create more jobs than it displaces. AI may create new jobs, new lines of business that we cannot imagine now, and help people do their jobs better. By developing proactive plans and policies, we can shape how AI will positively affect and improve the Future of Work (FoW). The following directions could be pursued:\n",
    "- Studying the impact of AI adoption in the Greek labour market. A two-fold objective should be targeted: (a) To figure out which skills and jobs AI will automate, in which sector, at what time, (b) To highlight opportunities for AI to help the FoW (taking also in account the new, extraordinary circumstances of the recent pandemic).\n",
    "- Develop a roadmap for the Future of Work in Greece.\n",
    "- Deploy that roadmap through programs to upskill/reskill the workforce for AI, placing emphasis on vulnerable groups.\n",
    "- Consult with institutional stakeholders (e.g., labour organizations, employers) regarding a new social contract that secures job positions through targeted programs for reskilling, training and lifelong learning.\n",
    "- Revise Social Security programs and introduce new instruments (e.g., UBI (Universal Basic Income)) to alleviate short term, adverse effects of AI in employment.\n",
    "- Prepare enterprises for the future of work.\n",
    "9.2.12 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 12: SUPPORT AI-BASED PROJECTS IN ARTS, HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES  \n",
    "Support the implementation of AI-based projects with high societal and cultural value, even when their economic impact is limited. Therefore, it is important to proactively support AI-based projects in Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, adopting an inclusive, multi-thematic and multidisciplinary approach to AI-funded projects. This could also include novel AI-projects (basic and applied research) that merge science, technology, humanities and arts contributing to social and cultural innovation, sustainability and inclusion. Such projects could reinforce the participatory AI dialogues with society by actively involving citizens as co-creators (passive, active) and ensure that technology becomes more creative, inclusive, and sustainable, aligned with societal needs. They would also act as means of education for the rest of society and projects of implicit, multidisciplinary experimentation using AI systems.\n",
    "It is also important to ensure that researchers and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) working on humanities, arts, and social sciences, have access to the national infrastructures for AI, as well as to knowledge and training. \n",
    "9.2.13 STRATEGIC DIRECTION 13: INCLUSIVE APPROACH TO AI DEVELOPMENT AND USE: AI FOR VULNERABLE GROUPS AND WOMEN IN AI \n",
    "As part of the inclusive and ethical dimension of AI systems in Greece, emphasis should be paid on ensure that no one is left behind in AI. Any programs for AI systems development must therefore ensure that AI system can also benefit vulnerable groups like disabled individuals. Likewise, all actions should ensure equal gender opportunities. Currently there is a proclaimed gender gap in the development and use of the AI system. In this context, Women in AI, will be a topic of strategic priority for the implementation of Greece's inclusive approach. \n",

    "10. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n",
    "The document presented the Hellenic National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (AI), as developed by a multidisciplinary team of Greek Scientists and AI Experts under the auspices and supervision of the Ministry of Digital Governance. The strategy outlines the strategic targets of the country for AI development and adoption, along with a range of concrete projects that will boost their realization. Specifically, the overarching goals of the strategy are:\n",
    " To leverage AI as a catalyst for economic growth. In this direction, the strategy plans for activities that foster the development of an AI-based innovation ecosystem and facilitate private sector enterprises to adopt, use and fully leverage AI in their business processes. Hence, the strategy's economic growth ambition is twofold: On the one hand it enables the demand side to take advantage of AI and on the other it creates an environment where innovators (including SMEs) will be able to develop and validate competitive AI products. National infrastructures and research initiatives are expected to play a key role in supporting and reinforcing the accomplishment of these economic targets.\n",
    " To effectively integrate in the on-going digital transformation of the country.  The strategy unveils the potential of AI to accelerate Greece's digital transformation.  Leveraging recent digital infrastructures (e.g., gov.gr, G-cloud, Digital Academy, Open Data Repositories)) and policy developments (e.g., the Digital Book of the country), AI could greatly boost the automation and intelligence of various public sector processes, while enhancing the quality of the services offered to the citizens. The strategy prescribes a rich set of reference projects in this direction.\n",
    " To ensure the ethical, responsible, accessible nature of AI developments in Greece and EU, with Greece in active role at the EU level. The strategy presents a vision for developing and adopting AI in-line with European values. Moreover, it describes a set of actions that could safeguard adherence to these values, including technical and policy measures. Many of the proposed measures and projects towards a \"democratic\" AI are novel and exhibit pioneering elements. The strategy aspires to set Greece as one of the EU leaders and main contributors in the \"democratization\" of AI. It envisages that Greece can play a very active role in relevant technology transfer, experience sharing and standardization at EU level.\n",
    "Building on national socio-economic priorities and specific objectives for Economic Growth, Digital Transformation and the strengthening of EU Values and Fundamentals Rights, the proposed Strategy structures the recommendations, actions, and key projects around three high level policy areas, namely: Policy Area I: AI Enabling Framework, Policy Area II: AI for Economic Growth and Digital Transformation, and Policy Area III: AI Principles.\n",
    "These three policy areas are decomposed into six, more fine-grained, core strategic targets to be accomplished. This strategy additionally defines and prioritises the strategic actions that will initiate and boost the implementation of the strategy. Furthermore, it presents the governance framework, structure, and methodology to oversee the implementation of actions and assess progress towards target achievement, including instruments and bodies to be organised as part of the strategy and international collaboration paths. \n",
    "The implementation timeline of the strategy will be reflected in the detailed Action plan that will be released later in 2021. As part of this Action Plan, several projects are planned for the first two years, following the launch of the strategy's implementation. The latter projects include core infrastructures development (e.g., databases, supercomputing capacity, human capital), yet they also comprise reference projects in all areas. The implementation of reference projects in all envisaged areas is expected to demonstrate AI's potential in the Greek society and to help building trust in AI. The strategy foresees the establishment of institutional teams that will closely monitor the implementation process and will perform regular adjustments. \n",
    "Overall, the present document represents the first release of the Strategy. The Ministry of Digital Governance and the team in charge of the strategy's realisation are committed to continually monitoring the implementation of the strategy, as a means of assessing its progress, revising its contents, and taking corrective actions when required. The present document is therefore the initial version of a \"living\" document that will be regularly updated subject to a continuous improvement discipline.  Overall, this strategy aspires to provide a sound basis for creating a vibrant AI ecosystem that will benefit the Greek Society and Economy, while providing a unique contribution to EU's Strategic Targets for AI, notably in terms of the EU-wide Democratisation of AI.\n",
