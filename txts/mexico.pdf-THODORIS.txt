TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Mexico faces a year of political transition during a time 
of change for the region and in the global economy. 
As  more  of  the  world’s  production  is  automated, 
Mexico has the opportunity to transform its economy 
and society by supporting local talent, innovation and 
growth in artificial intelligence (AI).

the lowest-earning 80% of Mexicans. While Mexico’s 
manufacturing  sector  is  growing,  with  employment 
and  exports  reaching  record  heights,  productivity 
is stagnating.2 This is preventing the economy from 
achieving even greater gains. AI could be one answer 
to Mexico’s productivity problem.

This  report  makes  the  case  for  Mexico  to  invest  in 
AI  now.  It  recommends  that  Mexico  join  countries 
including  the  United  Kingdom,  Canada,  China,  the 
UAE,  Singapore,  South  Korea,  France,  and  Japan 
and become one of the first ten countries in the world 
to deliver a National Strategy for AI. 

input 

from  experts  across  Mexico. 

This report was commissioned by the British Embassy 
in  Mexico  and  funded  by  the  UK  Prosperity  Fund. 
It  was  developed  by  Oxford  Insights  and  C  Minds 
with  the  collaboration  of  the  Mexican  Government 
and 
Its 
recommendations are based on a six week research 
period that included qualitative analysis of interviews 
with over 60 AI experts working in government, big 
technology companies, startups, academia and non-
governmental  organisations;  a  review  and  critical 
analysis of existing national AI strategies from around 
the world; and a quantitative analysis predicting the 
likely economic impact of AI on the Mexican labour 
market.1  

Report Findings

Our  interviewees  stressed  the  potential  of  social 
applications of AI in Mexico, including uses in health 
and education which might help improve services for 

Our analysis predicts that 19% of all jobs in Mexico 
(9.8 million jobs) will be affected by automation over 
the  next  two  decades,  ranging  from  tasks  being 
made easier by automated systems to jobs being fully 
replaced. The largest impacts in Mexico will be on the 
manufacturing and construction sectors. Since these 
sectors predominantly employ men, automation has a 
gendered dimension in Mexico and will require careful 
management to mitigate possible social dislocation. 

In Oxford Insights’ Government AI Readiness Index, 
Mexico  places  22nd  out  of  35  OECD  countries. 
Mexico  scores  well  for  its  digital  infrastructure  and 
open data policies but poorly in the areas of tech skills, 
digitalisation, and public sector innovation. These are 
crucial  preconditions  for  implementing  AI,  and  they 
are addressed in our recommendations. 

Our recommendations

Based  on  the  suggestions  and  advice  of  experts 
across  sectors,  and  on  our  research  into  the  key 
elements  of  national  artificial  intelligence  strategies 
from around the world, we make recommendations 
in  five  areas:  government  &  public  services;  data  & 
digital  infrastructure;  research  and  development; 
capacity, skills & education; and ethics. 

1. 

Several important areas were outside the scope of this report but should be included in a future National Strategy. These include cybersecurity, the judicial 
branch of government, and a more extensive analysis of impacts on economic growth and the labour market.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution The  role  of  government  will  be  critical:  to  set 
direction, provide support, and help different sectors 
collaborate. We recommend that the Government of 
Mexico creates a permanent office to implement and 
coordinate  Mexico’s  digital  and  artificial  intelligence 
policy. With elections set to take place in July 2018, 
we recommend that future administrations continues 
to see digital strategy as a national priority. Targeted 
use of digital tools will strengthen Mexico’s economy 
and  help  realise  the  benefits  of  cheaper  and  better 
services for citizens. 

Mexico’s  AI  sector  will  develop  faster  if  it  works 
together  more  closely  across  sectors,  and  we 
recommend  several  ways  to  do  this.  Already,  civil 
society  groups  are  collaborating  on  projects  and 
giving  feedback  to  government,  such  as    AI  2030 
roadmap. We believe that creating a national Mexican 
Centre for Artificial Intelligence, modeled on the Turing 
Institute  in  the  United  Kingdom,  would  also  help 
support  collaboration  between  industry,  academia, 
and government. It could help to commercialise the 
best ideas and to focus resources on areas with the 
highest potential. 

sciences and the arts, as well as mathematics and 
science.  These  will  also  support  easier  access  to 
lifelong  learning,  including  to  help  Mexican  citizens 
retrain when they need to.

Supporting  AI  developments  involves  continuing  to 
invest in the infrastructure that supports it - including 
good  quality  data,  internet  connectivity,  and  legal 
frameworks such as modern intellectual property law 
and privacy protections. Another essential part of this 
system  is  an  ethics  framework  to  help  guide  good 
decision-making by those who are finding new uses 
for  AI  technologies.  Like  other  technologies,  AI  will 
need to be used thoughtfully, inclusively and ethically 
in Mexico to achieve the greatest benefits for citizens.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution INTRODUCTION
What is AI, and why is it important?

What do we mean by AI?

Artificial  intelligence  (AI)  refers  to  machines,  and 
generally  computer  systems,  that  can  simulate  the 
processes of natural intelligence displayed by humans. 
These  processes  include  learning,  reasoning,  and 
self-correction.3  The  phrase  ‘artificial  intelligence’  is 
now an umbrella term that refers to a broad range of 
research approaches and technologies. 

intelligence,  or 

Developments  in  AI  fall  into  two  main  categories: 
artificial  narrow 
‘weak’  AI,  and 
artificial  general  intelligence,  or  ‘strong’  AI.  Narrow 
AI systems are designed to form one particular task. 
Current  AI  applications  using  narrow  AI  or  multiple 
narrow  AIs  include  speech  and  image  recognition, 
purchase  prediction,  targeted  advertising,  natural 
language  processing,  autonomous  lethal  weapons 
and  interactive  assistants  such  as  Apple’s  Siri  and 
Amazon’s Alexa. This form of AI is the focus of this 
report. Artificial general intelligence refers to a system 
that  can  perform  the  full  range  of  human  cognitive 
tasks.  This  includes  the  capacity  to  understand 
thoughts, motives, intentions and expectations, and 
interact socially. Such a system does not yet exist.

The  rapid  rise  of  AI  technologies  over  the  past  ten 
years has been largely due to advances in machine 
learning.  Machine  learning  is  a  subfield  of  AI  that 
involves  building  algorithms  which 
from 
experience and make predictions about data, without 

learn 

being explicitly told what to do. Machine learning has 
enabled us to solve complex problems in situations 
where  programming  specific  algorithms  is  difficult 
or infeasible. It is the fastest-growing area in AI, and 
one where many AI scientists are looking to for future 
developments. 

AI for economic and social 
development

“Mexico should aim at being a global leader 
in AI and digitalisation as a way of promoting 
development, both social and economic, for 
our citizens.” 
Enrique Zapata: General Director for Open Data, 
National Digital Strategy Office, Government of Mexico.

The  great  economic  and  social  potential  of  AI  is 
a  central  theme  in  the  discussion  of  its  possible 
impacts.  Current  research  forecasts  that  AI  could 
add  $15.7  trillion  dollars  to  the  global  economy  by 
2030,4 and double economic growth rates by 2035,5 
fundamentally  changing  the  way  we  think  about 
human work in the process.

In  Mexico,  micro,  small  and  medium  enterprises 
(MSMEs) are the backbone of the economy, generating 
72% of employment and contributing to 52% of the 
country’s GDP.6 In 2015, out of more than 4 million

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution companies, 97.6% were micro enterprises, and 74% 
of these did not use the internet or own a computer.7 
As noted by the OECD, the digitalisation of MSMEs 
is necessary to allow them to identify new business 
opportunities,  and  to  access  global  markets  and 
knowledge networks at relatively low cost. Moreover, 
Big Data, data analytics and AI can provide a wide 
range of opportunities for these companies, enabling 
a better understanding of their processes, the needs 
of their clients and partners, and the overall business 
environment.8

Although Mexico’s manufacturing sector is growing, 
with  employment  and  exports  reaching  record 
heights, productivity is stagnating.9 This is preventing 
the  economy  from  achieving  even  greater  gains.  AI 
could be the answer to Mexico’s productivity problem. 

Using AI systems, routine tasks which currently occupy 
a  large  amount  of  many  peoples’  working  days  can 
be  automated,  leaving  them  free  to  focus  on  more 
complex, high-level tasks which cannot yet be effectively 
performed  by  machines.  This  encourages  human 
creativity  and  innovation,  aspects  that  can  increase 
productivity. These impacts are discussed in greater 
detail in our section on economic impacts of AI, below. 

Future uses of AI may also enable cheaper, and more 
tailored, public services such as health and education. 
This  will  promote  greater  access  to  high-quality 
healthcare and schooling for the population, through 
applications  that  make  medical  diagnosis  quicker 
and faster, or help teachers to assess the needs of 
learners more effectively. 

The actors interviewed for this report, from all sectors, 
emphasised  the  importance  of  using  AI  for  social 
impact.  The  use  of  emerging  technologies  should 
focus on how they can be used to provide better living 
conditions for the Mexican population.

What are other countries 
doing?

Governments  around  the  world  are  waking  up  to 
the  transformative  power  of  AI  for  their  economies, 
public  services,  and  workforces.  Building  on  the 
now-widespread 
implementing  national 
digital  strategies, 
forward-thinking  governments 
are 
increasingly  recognising  the  need  to  have 
comprehensive national AI strategies. 

trend  of 

According to our research, as of March 2018, there 
are  seven  countries  who  have  publicly  announced 
policy approaches that they describe as AI strategies: 
Canada,  China,  the  UAE,  Singapore,  South  Korea, 
France,  and  Japan.  With  the  development  of  a 
national policy on AI, Mexico would be set to be the 
first nation in Latin America to join this elite club. India 
also  recently  announced  its  intentions  to  be  a  key 
player in the AI revolution, with the finance minister 
announcing in his budget speech in February10 that 
the government think tank Niti Aayog will spearhead a 
national programme on AI.

Other  countries  have  AI  strategies  under  different 
names. The UK’s AI policy is covered in two papers: 
Dame  Wendy  Hall’s  independent  review  of  the 
country’s AI industry,11 and the more recent Industrial 
Strategy,12 which identifies AI as one of four ‘Grand 
Challenges’ for the UK. The US’ approach is similarly 
spread over three reports published under the Obama 
administration,  including  a  specific  research  and 
development strategy paper,13 as well as two broader 
policy documents covering the potential impacts and 
considerations associated with implementing AI.14

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution Although different in style, the content of the existing 
national  AI  strategies  broadly  capture  a  number  of 
common themes. These themes, set out in Figure 1 and 
explained further below, are: using AI in government 
and  public  services;  skills  &  education;  research  & 
development; data & digital infrastructure and ethics. 
The countries we examined had varied takes on these 
themes, reflecting differing values and priorities. 

The majority of national strategies explicitly recognise 
the potential that AI holds for increasing government 
efficiency and the quality of public services. China’s 
strategy,  for  example,  proposes  a  system  of  public 
services  underpinned  by  AI,  from  education,  to 
healthcare, to justice, as well as AI having a key role 
in policy-making itself.15 Other countries are creating 

new institutions and networks to oversee AI research 
and  implementation.  The  UAE  recently  became  the 
first  country  in  the  world  to  install  a  Minister  for  AI, 
while the UK is in the process of establishing an Office 
for AI, to coordinate government efforts on AI.

Every existing AI strategy contains sections examining 
capacity,  skills,  and  education.  These    strategies 
vary in scope, but tend to recognise the importance 
of  teaching  digital  skills  from  an  early  stage  in  the 
national curriculum, as well as emphasising the need 
for  lifelong  learning  to  enable  workforces  to  adapt 
to new developments in technology. The majority of 
strategies recognised that developing high quality, in-
country AI expertise is vital for a country to remain at 
the forefront of the AI revolution.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution Similarly, investment in research and development was 
widely  acknowledged  as  key  to  ensuring  a  cutting-
edge national AI industry. Different governments had 
different approaches to this, often dependent on how 
advanced their AI sectors are already. The USA, for 
example, notes that much of the long-term research 
required for AI is not necessarily attractive to the private 
sector,16  while  France  recommends  guaranteeing 
capital to allow businesses to consistently take risks.17 

Given  that  advanced  digital  infrastructure  and  high-
quality data is an essential precondition for widespread 
AI implementation, the majority of AI strategies were 
surprisingly  muted  on  this  subject.  This  may  be 
because  these  preconditions  are  usually  addressed 
in  the  precursors  to  national  AI  strategies,  such  as 
national digital strategies, and so were assumed to be 
already sufficiently in place in the majority of countries 
with AI strategies. Some strategies contained policy 
recommendations 
for  enhancing  existing  data 
capabilities,  such  as  the  UK  AI  review’s  framework 
for ‘data trusts’, to enable confidence in data-sharing 
between organisations.18

Finally,  ethics  were  a  key  theme  in  almost  every 
in  recognition  of  the  complex  social, 
strategy, 
economic  and  political 
issues  associated  with 
widespread  AI  implementation.  Given  that  so  much 
is currently unknown about the likely impacts of AI, a 
common theme, shared by China, the USA, France, 
Canada,  and  the  UK,  is  a  strong  commitment  to 
further research in AI ethics. France is set to interview 
over  200  industrial,  academic,  and  legal  experts 
on  social  and  ethical  questions,  with  the  intention 
of  sparking  a  ‘national  debate’  on  AI.  France  and 
Canada have already tasked specific teams to focus 
on ethical issues, while the UK is establishing a world-
first Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation.

This AI strategy paper provides comprehensive and 
well-researched content for these themes and more, 
based on the unique strengths and challenges of the 
Mexican context.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution GOVERNMENT READINESS FOR AI: 
How does Mexico score?

In  December  2017,  Oxford  Insights  (OI)  released 
their world-first government AI readiness index. This 
set  out  to  answer  the  question,  how  well-placed 
are the governments of the OECD countries to take 
advantage of the benefits of AI for their public service 
delivery? A composite score was calculated for each 
government, derived from the average of nine input 
metrics covering areas ranging from in-country digital 
skills to government innovation.

Mexico  was  placed  22nd  in  the  rankings  out  of  35 
countries.  Table  1  below  details  the  breakdown  of 
Mexico’s ranking.

cluster  of  indicators,  notably  coming  fifth  for  data 
availability  and  ninth  for  data  capability.  These  high 
scores  reflect  Mexico’s  high  value  projects  in  open 

data  governance,  and  the  outcomes  of  the  current 
administration’s National Digital Strategy (NDS). Given 
that the availability of high-quality data is an essential 
precondition  for  the  implementation  of  AI,  this  is 
a  highly  positive  indicator  of  Mexico’s  readiness  for 
widespread AI adoption.

The AI readiness index also highlights areas for possible 
improvement. Mexico scores less well on public sector 
innovation, government effectiveness, in-country tech 
skills,  and  digitalisation.  The  recommendations  in 
this report seek to remedy these areas with targeted 
policy  recommendations  such  as  visa  schemes  to 
incentivise homegrown talent to return, and training 
schemes to nurture future generations of tech talent. 
The successful adoption of AI by government should 
also serve to improve indicators such as public service 
innovation and government effectiveness.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEXICO:
Building on strong foundations

 Our Observations

To  develop  this  report,  Oxford  Insights  and  C 
Minds  met  with  more  than  60  key  stakeholders  in 
government,  industry,  and  academia  at  both  the 
national and local levels. We hosted a workshop with 
representatives of startups and academics working in 
AI in Mexico City, and a dialogue with key actors from 
these fields in Jalisco. 

The Mexican Government and experts in all sectors 
are  committed  to  promoting  AI  in  the  country  in  a 
sustainable  and  scalable  way,  and  ensuring  that 
the  benefits  of  AI  are  maintained  across  changing 
administrations.  In  particular,  senior  figures  in  the 
Mexican Government see AI as one of the key ways to 
improve the quality of services for the lowest-earning 
80%  of  Mexican  citizens.  AI  applications  that  are 
already being developed in other parts of the world in 
health and education, for example, will enable poorer 
citizens to access higher-quality and cheaper services.

“I believe now, in the world that we are living, 
that innovation needs to be a integral part of 
the strategy. And it needs to be considered not 
only as a technology topic, but as a solution 
topic. Innovation is not a toy, it is a solution.”  
Martha González Pérez-Sandi: Director, Cognitive 
Solutions IBM Mexico 

The  stakeholders  we  interviewed  had  significant 
overlaps in their responses. They proposed a formal 
mechanism 
for  collaboration  between  sectors. 
this  would  better 
Stakeholders  explained 

that 

coordinate research and application of AI in Mexico, 
and would help those working in AI to learn from one 
another  more  rapidly.  Several  of  those  interviewed 
expressed  strong  support  for  the  creation  of  a 
national centre for AI, which we have included in our 
recommendations.

“One of the proposals we have been 
working on with the Scientific and 
Technological Consulting Forum (FCCyT for 
its acronym in Spanish)19 is for the creation 
of a national research centre... we have 
many people interested in AI but we need 
coordinated efforts. This will ideally be a 
hybrid between government, academia, 
and industry ...The easiest model would 
[be to] make it a Conacyt20 research centre 
while opening it up to industry participation. 
The Centre should also incubate and work 
with start-ups to develop local AI talent and 
industry. As for the academics, the centre 
should provide funding and an environment 
for mid to long term research projects… 
industry usually looks only at short term needs.”  
Enrique Sucar: Senior Research Scientist, National 
Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (INAOE)

“Where should a Center for Artificial 
Intelligence be placed? I think that general 
guidelines should be centralized, but 
implementation should be local, and 
solutions contextualized.”
María Cristina Cárdenas Peralta: General
Coordinator for @prende.mx

19.  The Scientific and Technological Consulting Forum’s (FCCyT for its acronym in Spanish) objective is to promote the application of scientific, academic and 

technological research, to formulate proposals of policies and scientific research, technological development and innovation programmes.

20.  Mexico’s National Council of Science and Technology (Conacyt for its acronym in Spanish) is Mexico’s entity in charge of the promotion of scientific and 

technological activities, setting government policies for these matters, and granting scholarships for postgraduate studies.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution When asked about capacity, all interviewees agreed 
that there are many talented people working on AI in 
Mexico.  However,  there  are  not  enough  specialists 
to  meet  demand  in  industry,  which  is  limiting  the 
amount of R&D taking place in the country. Big tech 
companies like Google and IBM are doing much of 
their  Latin  American  innovation  in  other  countries 
such as Brazil. In addition, there is a pressing need 
to  increase  general  digital  literacy  to  help  industry 
and government make good decisions about where 
AI can be best supported, developed, adopted, and 
deployed.

Given that big technology companies are not doing 
significant research and development on AI in Mexico, 
the role of Mexican AI startups is particularly important. 
This  is  a  nascent  community,  there  are  several 
entrepreneurs such as Krieger, Bluemessaging, Yalo, 
Data  Wuki  and  Nearshore  Solutions  among  many 
others, with innovative, growing companies leveraging 
their  own  developments 
learning, 
computer  vision  and  natural  language  processing. 
These  entrepreneurs  are  committed  to  growing  the 
Mexican  AI  community,  and  include  people  who 
left  opportunities  abroad  to  return  to  Mexico.  This 
community  of  entrepreneurs  and  academics  will 
be  important  advocates  during  a  period  of  political 
change.

Context

 National Digital Strategy

“Whoever wins the election, the message 
is clear, the world is digital, so you need to 
have the best team, at the cutting edge, to 
really make digital work for your people.” 
Yolanda Martinez: Coordinator, National Digital 
Strategy Office, Government of Mexico.

The  National  Development  plan  of  the  current 
administration has five major goals: to create peace; 
inclusion;  quality  of  education;  prosperity;  and 
establish Mexico in its appropriate place reflective of 
its global responsibility. Within the framework of this 
plan there are three programmes with goals to:

1.  democratise productivity;
2.  create a modern government; and
3.  promote gender equality.

The programme to create a modern government was 
the  impetus  for  the  creation  of  the  National  Digital 
Strategy  (NDS).  The  NDS  is  the  action  plan  being 
implemented  to  build  a  “Digital  Mexico,”  in  which 
technology and innovation contribute to achieving the 
country’s development goals.

The NDS has resulted in national policies in the areas 
of connectivity, interoperability, data, digital inclusion 
and  digital  skills,  along  with  efforts  to  ensure  the 
consistency of legislation governing digital government.

Connectivity 

The  Mexican  Government  has  made  advances  to 
increase  the  coverage  of  mobile  data  and  internet, 
including:

•  Red Compartida21  which will deliver 4G broadband 
connectivity to at least 92.2% of the population 

15

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution by 2024. This is the largest telecommunications 
investment project in the history of Mexico;

•  México  Conectado,22  a  programme  through 
which  free  internet  has  been  provided  to  more 
than  100,000  public  spaces  in  the  national 
territory; and

•  Red Troncalm,23 a programme that has seen the 
installation of more than 25,000 km of fibre optic 
cables.

Single portal and interoperability

The  Government’s  efforts  also  include  the  creation 
of  a  single  government  portal  and  steps  towards 
interoperability in government. 

•  Ventanilla Única Nacional is the single portal (gob.
mx) for citizens to access information, services, 
and  data.  It  also  provides  a  platform  for  citizen 
participation with the Mexican Government. 
InteroperaMX  is  a  platform  composed  of  six 
components  that  give  certainty  and  guidance 
for  interoperability  in  government.  These  are: 
normativity,24 the elite brigade,25  technical guides,26 
sources of trust,27 and reusable components.28

• 

Data

Data availability and quality is vital to AI research and 
to  the  usefulness  of  AI  programmes.  The  National 
Digital  Strategy  promotes  the  publication  of  open 
data  via  the  datos.gob.mx  platform.29  This  is  to 
create a collaborative ecosystem of public services, 

encouraging  innovation  and  entrepreneurship  by 
turning  information  traditionally  held  by  government 
into an asset of social value.

Mexico  participated  in  the  development  of  the 
international Open Data Charter,30 which was signed 
by the Federal Government. It was also the first country 
in the world to publish information on the planning, 
tendering, awarding, contracting and implementation 
stages  of  procurement  using  the  Open  Contracting 
Data  Standard,31  as  part  of  the  Open  Contracting 
Partnership.  Mexico  is  also  part  of  the  Contracting 
Alliance 5 (C5) network of countries.

Digital inclusion and digital skills

The Mexican Government has several programmes to 
encourage  digital  inclusion  and  the  development  of 
digital skills. For instance:
•  @prende 2.0:32  an initiative which aims to promote 
the development of digital skills and computational 
thinking with the potential of impacting 25 million 
students  enrolled  at  the  basic  education  level 
in  more  than  220,000  schools  and  1.5  million 
teaching staff in the public education system.

•  MéxicoX:33  an  online  platform  of  free  courses 
administered by the Ministry for Public Education 
(SEP), in coordination with the NDS and operated 
by 
the  General  Directorate  of  Educational 
Television. 

•  Código  X:34  an  initiative  that  promotes  the 
inclusion of girls and women in Information and

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution Communication Technology (ICT) by coordinating 
the  efforts  of  industry,  civil  society,  academia, 
and government to disseminate knowledge and 
opportunities. 

•  Mujer  Migrante:35  a  web  portal  that  provides 
reliable and timely information for migrant women 
and  their  families  in  Mexico  and  abroad,  but 
particularly in the US. Additionally, it provides free 
training in diverse ICT-related subjects, including 
e-commerce.
Industrial Innovation Centres (IICs):36 17 centres 
throughout  Mexico  created  by  the  Ministry 
of  Economy,  through  the  Programme  for  the 
Development of the Software Industry (PROSOFT), 
to  assist  in  the  adoption  and  development  of 
new technologies based on industry and market 
needs, as well as to develop human capital. 

• 

 Legislative framework

The  national  policies  above  have  been 
further 
promoted  by  the  development  of  a  variety  of 
complementary  laws  and  regulations.  The  Mexican 
Government seeks to harmonise the legal framework 
in order to foster an environment of confidence and 
certainty that favours the adoption and promotion of 
emerging  technologies.  Some  of  the  initiatives  that 
have served as a backbone include: 

Telecommunications reform

The 
telecommunication  amendment  of  201337  
recognises internet use as a fundamental right for all 
Mexicans (Art. 6). As such, the state commits itself to 
creating a competitive business environment suitable 
for  the  promulgation  of 
information  technology. 
Specifically, the article reads ‘the state will establish 
the  effective  conditions  for  competition  of  said 
services’.  The  law  also  creates  scope  for  ‘a  public 

decentralised  autonomous  non-profit  organisation’, 
which  resulted 
in  the  creation  of  the  Federal 
Telecommunications  Institute  (IFT),  to  regulate  and 
manage  broadcasting  and  telecommunications  (Art 
6.5).  The  law  also  grants  regulatory  control  to  the 
Federal  Commission 
for  Economic  Competition  
(COFECE  for  its  acronym  in  Spanish)  in  Article  28. 
This  reform  increases  competition,  promotes  the 
deployment  of  telecommunications  infrastructure, 
and establishes the Universal Digital Inclusion Policy 
as an obligation of the state. It also establishes the 
goal  of  connecting  70%  households  to  the  internet 
along with 85% of MSMEs. 

The Law for Science and Technology

Generally, this law establishes the basis for decision-
making  in  the  subjects  of  science,  technology  and 
innovation. Its main objectives are to:

•  Regulate the support that the Federal Government 
is obliged to provide in order to boost, strengthen, 
develop  and  consolidate  scientific  research, 
technological  development  and  innovation  in 
general throughout the country; and

•  Establish  means  of  coordination  with 

local 
governments, 
the  scientific  community,  and 
academic institutions for the creation of policies 
for the promotion, development, and application 
of science and technology. 

The law also creates the following three organisations: 

1.  The  Scientific  and  Technological  Consulting 
Forum (FCCyT for its acronym in Spanish), whose 
objective is to promote the application of scientific, 
academic, technological research into economic 
applications,  and  to  help  develop  proposals  of 
policies  and  scientific  research,  technological 
development, and innovation programmes;

fundamental  national  issues  that  have  social 
impact and contribute to the development of the 
country; and

(Consejo  General  de  Investigación  Científica, 
Desarrollo Tecnológico e Innovación) as a political 
coordination  authority.  It  seeks  to  establish 
national  science,  technology  and 
innovation 
policies.

Importantly, Article 9 of this law states that the annual 
budget for the state towards scientific research and 
technological  development  should  not  be  less  than 
1% of the GDP of the country.

Data protection laws 

The  ‘Federal  Law  for  Data  Protection  held  by 
Particulars’ establishes that all necessary and sufficient 
measures  must  be  taken  to  guarantee  that  the 
privacy statement provided to the owner of the data 
is respected at all times by the responsible authorities 
or  any  third  party.  This  legislation  establishes  that 
the  Federal  Institute  for  Access  to  Information  and 
Data  Protection  (Instituto  Federal  de  Acceso  a  la 
Información y Protección de Datos) and the Ministry of 
Economy are the responsible authorities to safeguard 
the data of the people. 

The  ‘General  Law  for  the  Protection  of  Personal 
Data in Possession of Obliged Subjects’ dictates the 
basis  of,  and  principles  and  processes  relevant  to, 
guaranteeing  individuals’  rights  to  the  protection  of 
their personal data. “Obliged Subjects” are any entity 
that  benefits  from  public  funds,  including  political 
parties  and  trusts,  in  addition  to  Federal,  State 
and  Municipal  authorities.  This  law  establishes  the 
requirements  and  conditions  and  clear  procedures 

18

that govern how personal data is treated by Obliged 
Subjects,  including  the  exercise  of  the  rights  of 
access,  clarification,  cancellation,  and  opposition. 
Additionally, this law’s objective is to protect personal 
data  in  possession  of  any  authority,  entity,  arm  or 
organisation from the executive, legislative, or judicial 
branches  of  government,  as  well  as  independent 
bodies,  political  parties,  trusts  and  other  publicly 
funded bodies, at federal, state, and municipal levels, 
with the purpose of regulating the proper treatment of 
such data.

The  general  law  regulates  the  organisation  and 
operation  of  the  National  System  for  Transparency, 
Access to Information, and Personal Data Protection 
(Sistema  Nacional  de  Transparencia,  Acceso  a  la 
Información y Protección de Datos Personales) and it 
also guarantees that every person can exercise their 
right to the protection of personal data.

These  data  protection  laws  line  up  with  the  judicial 
framework of the NDS in regards to the encouragement 
of  privacy  and  protection  of  personal  data.  They 
also relate to the goal of interoperability, particularly 
through simplifying communication between citizens 
and the government. Article 57 of the law establishes 
that  citizens  have  the  right  to  grant  access  to  their  
personal data.

does  grant  protection  to  computer  programmes  in 
accordance  with  the  International  Treaties  of  which 
Mexico  is  a  party,  such  as  the  The  Agreement  on 
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 
(TRIPS). In terms of the development of AI it will be 
important to have flexible intellectual property regimes.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution Enabling Data Trusts: Example of The Fintech Law

The recently-passed law regulating financial services (commonly known as the Fintech Law) opens the 
possibility for the creation of data trusts for companies wishing to use real data to train their models and 
develop AI for impact. The law formally introduces into the regulatory framework several concepts used 
widely in industry. For example, it provides a ‘regulatory sandbox’ modelled on similar structures in the UK, 
allowing innovative companies to test out their business models with access to data and relevant tools. 
These companies must obtain a temporary authorisation (of no more than two years), during which time 
they can provide their services to a reduced number of clients. This should potentially allow for a flexible 
approach to regulation in a constantly changing environment. The regulatory sandboxes were intended for 
use primarily by Fintechs, but also open the possibility of creating data trusts.

state’s  vocation.  With  technology  industry  clusters 
in  place,  and  an  existing  degree  of  collaboration 
between  government,  academia  and 
industry, 
Jalisco,  Mexico  City,  and  Nuevo  Leon,  are  leading 
the  way  to  incorporate  new  technologies,  such  as 
AI,  into  product  manufacturing  and  service  delivery. 
They  are  also  investing  in  skills  development  and 
in  creating  highly-specialized  jobs  and  trainings. 
Appendix 2 provides examples of existing technology 
and  innovation  policies,  key  institutions,  and  major 
economic sectors in these states.

Moving forward, it will be crucial for local governments 
to continue coordinating strategies under the Federal 
government’s  direction,  as  the  social  impact  of  AI 
will be measured to the extent that local authorities 
have both the technical capacity and human capital 
to implement and follow-through such action plans.

The NDS created the Office for the Coordination of 
National Digital Strategy (CEDN), which forms part of 
the office and administration of the President.  

Mexico is set to hold elections in July 2018. 
The elections will result in a new President and 
administration, which may also change the structure 
of digital government within Mexico. 

Many interviewees stressed the importance of 
creating an independent body to oversee the 
implementation and coordination of both digital and 
AI policies to ensure continuity. This is reflected in 
our recommendations.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution Academia: areas of research 
expertise 

Between 2002 to 2017, Mexico’s National Council 
of Science and Technology (Conacyt) supported 
144 projects related to AI, with an investment of 
more than 432 million Mexican pesos. Conacyt has 
supported 16 projects on data mining and big data 
between 2011 and 2017. This accounts for about 
10% of the total amount that has been invested in 
AI projects. The number of people in the National 
Network of Researchers (SNI in Spanish) in fields 
related to AI and Big Data is 464, of whom 141 
specialise in AI. Most of these researchers live in 
Mexico City, Guanajuato, the State of Mexico, Jalisco 
and Nuevo Leon, as shown in Figure 2 below.

The purpose of the SNI is to promote and 
strengthen, through rigorous evaluation, the quality of 
scientific and technological research and innovation 
in Mexico. The SNI has seven “commissions” 

organised by thematic disciplines. Many of the 
academics with research specialities in AI and other 
associated disciplines expressed frustration that 
their work did not adequately fall within any of the 
seven commissions. Their work and publications are 
not being evaluated by the SNI using international 
standards for computational sciences or AI.  We 
interviewed, for example, a computer scientist who is 
currently classified as a linguist under the current SNI 
structure. The academic community argued that this 
has an adverse effect on Mexico’s ability to attract 
and retain top-level academic expertise and talent. 
Furthermore, many of those interviewed felt that 
professors are burdened with undue administrative 
loads and excessive teaching requirements. Under 
these conditions the production of new knowledge 
or innovative research becomes secondary. 

Many interviewees agreed that Mexico has the 
potential to be very attractive for students. In 
particular, this is because of the scholarship funding 
available. Conacyt has a scholarship programme that 
recently awarded its 400,000th scholarship since the 
programme was created.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution Talent development for R&D: postgraduate 
programmes in AI 

Mexico  has  a  growing  number  of  postgraduate 
programmes related to AI. Those relevant disciplines 
are  computer  sciences,  data  and 
information 
sciences, electronics, and telecommunications.  

As  shown  in  Table  2,  there  is  only  one  university 
programme which specialises in AI, with another soon 

to be formed. Postgraduate programmes in computer 
science  are  burgeoning  and  the  total  number  is 
likely  to  double  in  the  next  few  years.  Meanwhile, 
more  traditional  cognate  fields  of  electronics  and 
telecommunications  are  well  established.  The  key 
question for the future is whether these programmes 
will be able to meet international standards. This may 
require an increased emphasis on academia, including 
a restructuring of the SNI as well as increasing funding 
available for academics.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution AI Use Cases 

There are valuable examples of AI being developed 
and deployed across Mexico. Their applications 
include:  

improving transport mobility;

improving operational efficiency at the local levels;

•  making agricultural processes more efficient;
• 
•  developing technical skills;
• 
•  countering fake news in natural disasters;
• 
• 

improving user experience on public transport; and
improving government communication efficiency 
via chatbots.

This section highlights examples of where AI is 
currently being used in Mexico to improve public 
services and to make citizen’s lives better. 

 Use cases at the national level 

AI for better health public services: misalud, 
Ministry of Health 

Misalud is a new health platform that enables patients 
to ask questions and receive advice  through their cell 
phone. It was launched in June 2017 as a result of 
the government’s Prospera digital pilot and focuses 
on  maternal  health.  Beneficiaries  of  misalud  receive 
SMS  messages  with  advice  to  help  improve  their 
health  and  that  of  their  babies.  To  date,  more  than 
5,000 women have exchanged more than one million 
SMS  messages  through  the  platform.  The  CEDN 
is  supporting  the  initiative  to  develop  chatbots  for 
government  communication  as  a  ‘plug  and  play’ 
innovation.

AI to detect fraudulent taxpayer operations: Tax 
Administration Service, Ministry of Finance and 
Public Credit 

The  Tax  Administration  Service  has  been  trialling  AI 
algorithms to detect companies that are conducting 
fraudulent  operations,  by 
identifying  pattern 

disruptions in data analysed using R Studio, Python 
Language,  and  DBs  in-memory  Redis.  Within  three 
months of a six month pilot scheme, 1200 fraudulent 
companies  were  detected  and  3500  fraudulent 
transactions identified. The identification and analysis 
of  these  irregular  activities  would  have  taken  an 
estimated 18 months of work without the use of AI.

 Use cases at the regional level

AI for more efficient agriculture: KYSO Agritech, 
Mexico City

has  optimised  crop  outputs  by  54%  in  comparison 
to  current  processes.  KYSO  is  training  and  piloting 
their algorithm in Milpa Alta (CDMX) and Cuernavaca 
(Morelos) and working closely with local farmers.

AI for optimising the flow of buses: Laboratorio 
para la Ciudad/Datank, Mexico City

Laboratorio para la Ciudad and SM1 are collaborating 
with the startup Datank in a project to use data from 
the GPS within SM1 buses to create a more efficient 
system for bus departures. The project will start with 
routes that start and finish in Santa Fe. If the tool is 
successful, the team will seek to replicate this for all of 
the routes in the city. 

AI for skills development: Wizeline Academy, 
Guadalajara

Wizeline  AI  Academy  offers  engineers,  computer 
scientists,  mathematicians,  and  statisticians  tuition-
free  coursework  on  AI,  machine 
learning,  and 
other  advanced  software  engineering  skills  and 
technologies.  Their  short  programmes  also  push 
talented  students  towards  high-level  professional 
roles through 1:1 mentorship focusing on leadership 
development.

23

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution Autonomous  University  of  Mexico  (UNAM)  and  the 
Human-Computer  Interaction  (HCI)  lab  at  West 
Virginia  University  focused  on  automating  some  of 
the  critical  bottlenecks  that  networks  of  volunteers 
experienced when verifying news. They also created 
a  bot  that  used  machine  learning  to  identify  and 
distribute verified citizen reports on social media and 
provide influencers with real-time information to post.  

AI for an efficient flow of passengers: Metro 
CDMX

In  2015,  PhD  students  from  UNAM  won  the  first 
prize at a technological innovation contest organized 
by  CDMX’s  Ministry  of  Science,  Technology  and 
Innovation  (SECITI)  and  the  Metro  transportation 
system. Throughout that year, they worked with Line 
1 Metro staff using AI to analyse large datasets about 
passenger flow dynamics, coming up with a strategy 
based  on  computer  simulations  to  reduce  train 
boarding and alighting times. Given the success of the 
pilot in metro Balderas, the solution was expanded to 
other 14 metro stations, helping to minimize delays 
and contributing to a more efficient flow of passengers 
by 10 to 15%.

Fostering a technology innovation culture and 
digital skills: Jalisco Talent Land

Internet  communities. 

This event brings together more than 30,000 digital 
natives,  aged  between  18-35  years  old,  and  more 
than  600 
Its  programme 
offers  training  to  develop  digital  skill-sets,  seeks  to 
catalyze the connection of young talent with industry 
and government, and highlights the role of emerging 
technologies, including AI, to solve social challenges 
collaboratively. Jalisco Talent Land is an example of 
collaboration  for  technology  innovation  at  all  levels: 
federal  and  local  governments,  academia,  industry 
and civil society. 

AI for government efficiency: One Smart City, 
Guadalupe (NL) & Tlanepantla de Baz (State of 
Mexico) 

One  Smart  City  creates  and  curates  software 
technology 
to  become  more 
innovative, efficient, and transparent via the use of AI.  

for  governments 

In  2016,  One  Smart  City  piloted  their  SmartUNO® 
software in the cities of Guadalupe, Nuevo León and 
Tlalnepantla de Baz, State of Mexico. The software 
generates algorithms that facilitate the understanding 
of  digital  discourse  in  social  networks  and  creates 
actionable content for governments. 

AI for better public services: URBEM, Nuevo Leon 

URBEM,  developed  by  Civica  Digital,  is  a  tool  that 
uses an AI-enabled chatbot in Facebook Messenger 
to answer citizens’ requests for information, provide 
documents, and gather feedback. It also provides a 
means of centralising data, and combines this with an 
internal administrative dashboard.

Nuevo  Leon’s  Undersecretary  of  Legal  Affairs  and 
Citizen Services used URBEM in a pilot for their call 
centre to drive efficiency in the provision of information 
related  to  the  Civil  Registry.  The  Facebook  chatbot 
provides all Civil Registry-related information to around 
200 daily users with an 82% rate of service satisfaction. 
This has freed staff from routine requests and allowed 
them to focus on more complicated cases. 

The  Municipalities  of  San  Pedro  Garza  Garcia, 
Nuevo Leon, and Hermosillo, Sonorawill use URBEM 
to  provide  a  single  portal  for  citizens  to  access 
information  about  the  status  of  local  utilities  and  to 
report any problems.

 
AI for countering fake news: Sismo 19s

On  September  19,  2017,  Mexico  City  was  hit  with 
a  7.1  magnitude  earthquake.  People  used  social 
media  to  learn  about  what  was  happening  in  their 
neighborhoods  and  coordinate  aid  activities.  A

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution LIKELY IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE

Global overview and 
introduction 

Recent  research  suggests  that  automation  has  the 
potential to add $15.7 trillion to the world economy by 
2030. This is equivalent to a 14% gain in global GDP.40 
This will be driven by improvements in the productivity 
of  processes  and  workforces  through  automation, 
and growth in consumer demand as a consequence 
of greater personalisation in the provision of products 
and services.

The  distribution  of  these  economic  gains  across 
countries  and  regions  will  be  dependent  on  many 
factors, including the speed of adoption in the private 
sector,  the  sectoral  constitution  of  economies  and 
the  extent  to  which  such  sectors  are  automatable, 
and  government  policies  supporting  innovation  and 
research and development. The context particular to 
Mexico is explored below. 

While  enhanced  GDP  growth  has  the  potential  to 
raise  living  standards  and  generate  new  consumer 
markets,  there  remains  a  significant  risk  of  job 
losses in certain sectors. Recent studies conducted 
by  PwC  and  McKinsey 
identify  manufacturing, 
accommodation  and  food  services,  the  automotive 
industry,  healthcare,  and  financial  services  as  being 
particularly susceptible to widespread automation.41

These  conclusions  carry  particular  significance 
for  Mexico.  Manufacturing  represents  the  largest 
component  of  the  Mexican  economy,  at  20%  of 
Mexican GDP in 2016. McKinsey’s study suggested 
that 64% of global working hours in manufacturing are 
automatable,42 which implies that Mexico is especially 
exposed to such risk. 

This risk is exacerbated by the supply chains that drive 
the Mexican manufacturing sector: should automation 
become cheap enough that it is more cost-effective to 
produce goods automatically in the USA, rather than 
using Mexican labour, production could be relocated 
away from Mexico, meaning an even more severe loss 
of capital.43 

As our analysis demonstrates, negotiating the trade-
offs  between  job  losses  and  enhanced  sectoral 
growth as a result of AI will be a key challenge facing 
policy makers in the upcoming years.

Finding jobs and automation 

Our research found that 19% of all jobs in Mexico (or 
9.77 million jobs) will be affected by automation. We 
estimate  that  16%  of  these  9.77  million  jobs  (1.54 
million jobs) will be affected by automation in the next 
5 years, and almost 75% of these jobs (7.19 million 
jobs) between the next 5 and 15 years.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution In our analysis, ‘affected by automation’ refers to a 
range  of  outcomes.  For  some  jobs,  automation  will 
enhance  the  capacity  of  the  individual  worker  to 
perform  tasks,  increasing  labour  productivity.  Other 
jobs will be easier to fully automate, leading to either 
a transformation of the individual worker’s role or even 
their full replacement by automated systems. This will 
still ensure productivity growth, but the overall gains 
here  must  be  offset  against  the  costs  of  providing 
benefits and re-skilling newly unemployed workers.
 
Of  all  the  jobs  that  can  be  automated  globally,  we 
estimate  that  51%  will  merely  see  tasks  enhanced, 
33% of automatable jobs will be transformed, while a 
final 16% will see full replacement of workers through 
automated systems. Applying these general figures to 
the the total number of jobs at risk of automation in 
Mexico’s workforce, we estimate that 4.97 million jobs 
in Mexico stand to be enhanced by automation; 3.20 
million will be transformed by automation; and 1.61 
million will be fully replaced. 

 Sectoral analysis and the future of work

The  impacts  of  automation  on  employment  will  be 
spread variably across sectors in Mexico. In terms of 
the number of jobs automated in some form, the top 
sectors affected will be manufacturing, construction, 
wholesale  and  retail,  agriculture,  accommodation 
and food services. This is because jobs within these 
sectors  are  made  up  of  tasks  that  are  especially 
amenable  to  automation,  given  the  current  and 
projected capacities of AI.

The  highest  overall  impacts  of  automation  on  the 
Mexican economy are likely to come from automation 
in  manufacturing  and  construction.  Manufacturing 
and construction are the largest two sectors in terms 
of jobs exposed to automation (2.8 million and 1.75 
million respectively; see Table 3), while comparatively 
high proportions of jobs will also be affected in these 

sectors.  Construction  will  be  affected  most  overall 
in terms of the share of jobs automated, at 41.08%, 
while  manufacturing  is  ranked  second,  at  33.71%. 
Policy  interventions  must  therefore  target  these 
sectors  specifically  in  order  to  guide  transformation 
and minimise social disruption. 

Other  sectors  will  see  a  high  proportion  of  jobs 
affected,  but  their  relatively  small  size  in  terms  of 
overall employment will make the social and economic 
impacts less severe in terms of the overall economy. 
Mining  is  one  such  sector:  it  is  the  third-highest 
ranked sector in terms of proportion of jobs capable 
of automation (33.12%), but employs a relatively small 
number of workers in total (0.21 million workers).  

Given these possible impacts of automation on jobs over 
the next 15 years, a far-reaching skills policy is required. 
One interviewee reflected that this is not simply a case 
of funding more science, technology, engineering and 
mathematics  (STEM)  programmes.  Flexibility  in  re-
skilling and education should be emphasised; one good 
option is to consider shorter educational programmes 
than those that currently exist. Broadly, this interviewee 
suggested, Mexico needs to recognise that new skills 
are needed in the country. 

The  changes  in  work  brought  by  automation  will 
also  have  consequences  for  Mexico’s  policies  on 
tackling  inequality.  Coordinator  of  National  Digital 
Strategy, Yolanda Martinez, remarked in our interview 
that  “[e]verything  we  do  needs  to  be  measured  in 
terms  of  how  we  reduce  the  inequality  gap  and 
how we use everything we do to make lives better”. 
Where  automation  enhances  jobs,  the  benefits  of 
any  productivity  increases  might  be  returned  into 
wage increases or invested into further innovation in 
neglected  sectors.  Where  jobs  are  replaced,  there 
is an opportunity for widespread re-skilling targeted 
at  those  who  have  not  previously  gained  from  the 
proceeds of growth.

 Gender and automation

There is a clear disparity between genders in terms of 
the proportion of jobs at risk from automation. Over 
twice as many jobs at risk of automation are held by 

men than by women: 9.8 million automatable jobs are 
held by men, and 2.8 million are held by women. This 
means that 12.8% of men’s jobs risk being automated, 
compared to just 5.53% for women. Table 5 below 
breaks down these differences by sector.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution Table  4  partly  reflects  the  fact  that  more  men  are 
employed  in  Mexico  than  women:  men  make  up 
61.8% of the formal workforce, and women 38.2%. 
Nevertheless, in sub-sectors where women make up 
a higher proportion of workers, there is a relatively low 
risk of jobs being automated. For example, women 
make up 90.51% of self-employed workers (a sector 
that includes ‘domestic workers’); in this sub-sector, 
just 1.25% jobs are at risk. This is the lowest risk of 
all  sectors.  Similarly,  construction  is  the  sector  with 
the highest proportion of male workers (96.91%). Of 
all sectors, construction has the highest proportion of 
jobs at risk (41.08%). More generally, and as Figure 5 
shows, there is a correlation between the proportion 
of male workers in a sector and a higher risk of job 
automation within that sector. 

The methodology used in this section can be found 
in Appendix 3.
 

Figure 5: % Sector Male vs. Risk of Automation 

While, as stated, the observations detailed in Figure 
5  must  be  balanced  against  the  predominance  of 
men  in  the  workforce  in  general,  and  the  relatively 
small size of some of the sectors particularly at risk 
of automation, the gender disparity has implications 
for  Mexico’s  future  social  policy.  If  women  continue 
to take jobs in service sectors rather than in industry 
and  agriculture,  and  should  the  Mexican  economy 
show  a  similar  movement  from  industry  to  services 
as  has  been  evident  across  the  developed  world, 
automation  in  sectors  that  are  both  declining  and 
relatively  automatable  will  affect  male  employment 
rather  than  female  employment.  To  avoid  high 
male  unemployment,  and  likely  subsequent  social 
disruption,  a  concerted  re-skilling  effort  will  be 
required.  Equally,  as  more  women  move  into  the 
labour market, it is crucial to ensure that they possess 
sufficiently high skills to insulate them against potential 
automation risks.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution RECOMMENDATIONS

Any recommendations that follow are only possible 
because of parallel work in related fields taking place 
in Mexico, including:

investments in data and open data;

• 
•  efforts to digitise government;
•  digital inclusion; and
•  actions by academia, industry and civil society.

Mexico has a young and talented labour force, 
an early mover advantage if it is among the first 
countries to announce an AI strategy, and close 
economic and cultural relationships both with North 
and South American countries which are making 
strides in AI research and applications. 

These recommendations also reflect on Mexico’s 
starting position, which is different from other 

countries such as the UK, USA or Canada. There 
is not the same historic investment in connecting 
academic research and industry or as many 
examples of multi-million companies based largely 
on commercialising intellectual property.

Based on the suggestions and advice of experts 
across sectors, and on our research into the key 
elements of national artificial intelligence strategies 
from around the world, we make recommendations 
in five areas: government & public services; data 
& digital infrastructure; research and development; 
capacity, skills & education; and ethics. Many of 
these are recommendations for government; others 
concern universities or civil society actors. Wherever 
possible, we have stated the actor we think should 
be responsible for implementation.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution Governance, 
government and 
public services 

 The role of government

The widespread application of machine learning, and 
the speed at which breakthroughs are occuring, gives 
government a critical role in shaping AI development, 
uses and applications. In order to support the Mexican 
economy and promote the use of AI in Mexico, we 
recommend that the Mexican Government should: 

1. Set a clear strategic direction

A  cross-cutting,  central  government  department 
should  own  the  National  AI  Strategy.  AI  is  an 
enabling  technology  and  touches  on  almost 
every  department  in  government,  either  through 
government  support,  promotion  or  in  delivery. 
That central department should have a ‘Office for 
AI’ to support implementation which will largely be 

done  by  departments.  The  Government  should 
appoint an official to lead on AI who should act 
as a champion across government and help liaison 
between sectors. 

a. Short-term recommendation T1 (current
administration): Publication of the AI strategy 
by  the  Government;  The  AI  Steering  Group 
(proposed below) can enable a wide cross-sector 
consultation  process  on  the  recommendations 
for an AI National Policy. 

b. Short-term recommendation T2 (transition 
phase):  The  new  elected  Administration 
designs  the  administrative  framework  of  the 
Office for AI based on its administration strategy, 
lessons  learned  by  the  Mexican  Government 
international case studies and the input of the 
Steering Group.

c. Medium term recommendation T3 (new 
administration):  The  new  Administration 
develops  and  publishes  an  AI  National  Policy; 
deploys a 100 day AI action plan and continues 
to  implement  the  AI  National  Policy  in  close 
collaboration with the AI Steering Group.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution 2. Appoint Emergent Technology Innovation   
 
teams in selected Ministries (current and 
  new administration) 

Develop  official  job  descriptions  and  institutional 
conditions  to  attract  experts  in  data  science, 
algorithmic thinking, and machine learning. Include 
such profiles not only in the technical teams but in 
the programme development teams.

3. Act as a champion (current and next 
  administration) 

Government has enormous power to change the 
national conversation and direct attention. It should 
harness  this  power  to  champion  Mexico  as  a 
strategic place to build and deploy AI technology 
through  e.g.  supporting  the  creation  of  an  AI 
chamber  of  commerce,  actively  attracting  the 
best  talent  to  return  or  come  to  work  in  Mexico 
and ensuring that stories of successful Mexican AI 
deployments are shared internationally.

4. Develop guidelines for smart AI procurement 
 

(next administration)

In order to better provide high-quality services for 
citizens, government needs to embrace technology. 
In the right place AI is one of those technologies, 
and it will be increasingly useful over the coming 
years. As AI is so new it requires an approach to 
partnership and procurement which embraces that 
novelty, recognises that a lot of the expertise falls 
outside  government,  and  minimises  risk.  In  line 
with the digital strategy IT procurement guidelines, 
the Office for AI should work with departments to:

a. Talk to the emergent Mexican AI sector to

foster mutual understanding and stimulate ideas 
on how AI could help government provide better 
services for less.

b. Take a portfolio approach to develop and procure 

AI products and services in government.

Alliance,  UNECLAC  etc.,  taking  advantage  of  its 
current leadership position in these spaces.  This 
cooperation  between  states  is  the  only  way  to 
provide a coherent operational framework for the 
supra-national  companies  which  are  operating  in 
this space.

While the above are recommendations for government, 
the final governance recommendation concerns civil 
society:

4.  Create a coalition of AI practitioners from
  all sectors and disciplines - including
  national and local actors - to develop a  
  multi-sector, integral 2030 AI Road Map (civil 
 

society)

This  group  would  focus  on  creating  an  inter-
sector long term AI Road Map that goes beyond 
government  administrations  and  is  based  in  the 
concept of mutual sector responsibility. This would 
enable  a  better  coordination  among  sectors  and 
different  levels of  government  towards  leveraging 
AI  benefits  in  an  integral  way.  It  would  work 
collaboratively  with  existing  important  research 
centers  and  networks  such  as  the  Mexican  AI 
Society,  Scientific  and  Technological  Consulting 
Froum, and the government digital commissions, 
among others.

 Governance arrangements

1.  Create a Commission that includes actors 
 
from all sectors as advisors to develop and 
  promote Mexico's Government Strategy on AI 
 
  administration continuation).

(current administration and new

We recommend creating a formal and permanent 
AI  commission  within  the  government,  which 
includes  key  actors  of  all  sectors  to  advise  on 
the  development,  implementation  and  promotion 
of Mexico’s Strategy for AI towards a National AI 
Policy.

2.  Create an AI Working Group in Congress 
 

(Deputies and Senate)  

The  promotion  of  AI  should  be  included  in  all 
sectors  of  government.  An  AI  Working  Group  in 
Congress,  led  by  members  of  the  Science  and 
Technology  Commissions  at  both  the  Chamber 
of  Deputies  and  Senate,  should  work  with  the 
Executive  and  seek  advice  from  experts  to  build 
capacity  and  understanding  among  legislators 
about  AI  challenges  and  opportunities.  The  AI 
Working Group would study other countries’ best 
practices  on  AI  laws  being  drafted  and  organise 
round-table discussions to start ideating a flexible 
legal framework suitable for Mexico.

3.  Take a lead role in the global debate (current 
  and new administration)  

The Mexican government is a global leader in data 
and digital issues. The government should take a 
leading  role  in  addressing  the  global  challenges 

32

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution Research and
development 

AI  is  an  emergent  area,  and  like  any  new  area  it 
requires  focus  and  investment  both  in  primary 
research and the application of that to problems and 
challenges in the Mexican economy, as shown in the 
diagram below.

In  order  to  accelerate  this  journey,  we  recommend 
that Mexico: 

5.  Strengthen connections between academia 
  and industry (next administration) 

4.  Create a national centre for AI research 
 

(next administration) 

Modelled on the Turing Centre in the UK but with a 
broader scope, Conacyt should fund the creation 
of  a  national  centre  for  AI  bringing  together  the 
leading  scientists  (including  social  scientists)  and 
mathematicians  researching  AI.  With  dedicated 
funding, a physical campus and a model drawing 
on  multiple  campuses  and  centres  of  expertise, 
the  national  centre  will  help  to  provide  a  space 
and  venue  for  cross-disciplinary  work.  As  an 
internationally  connected  institution  it  will  play 
a  key  role  in  positioning  Mexico  on  the  global 
stage. This new centre should play a leading role 
in  creating  a  new  eighth  board  on  the  national 
system  for  researchers  (SNI),  to  govern  research 
in computational sciences and artificial intelligence.

Research  and  industry  should  have  a  symbiotic 
relationship. Industry feeds academic research; and 
academia provides novel techniques and insights 
for  industry.  There  are  three  elements  which  can 
help:

a. Introduce sector councils - Tec de Monterrey
has a model which brings in representatives from 
industry to help set the priorities for courses that 
give e.g. medical students the skills they need to 
operate in the digital world. This model should 
be used to assemble councils which look at the 
problems  that  the  sector  faces,  and  to  set  a 
framework under which some research funding 
is  allocated,  ensuring  that  research  directly 
benefits Mexican business.

b. Support university spin outs - Universities in 
countries which do well in building IP businesses 

33

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution AI  programmes  to  be  protected  rather  than 
requiring  that  only  physical  products  can  be 
patented.
 

c. Data sandbox (next administration) - The
national centre for AI research should create a 
safe space for data to be exchanged to facilitate 
collaboration between researchers and industry. 
This could be based on the research in the UK’s 
Turing Institute or the on work of Sandy Pentland 
at MIT.
 

d. Create new fiscal incentives for R&D and

This 
aligning 
requirements,  evaluations  and  grants  in  main 
government 
(Fondos 
Conacyt,  FNE,  e-México).  This  fund  should 
prioritise riskier investments with high rewards, 
fostering new products and services that solve 
local challenges. This is to help avoid the current 
challenge  of  funding  only  those  products  or 
services that have already been successful. 

4.  Create an AI government fund (next 
  administration)   

This should be achieved by aligning requirements, 
evaluations and grants in main government funding 
mechanisms  (Fondos  Conacyt,  FNE,  e-México). 
This fund should prioritise riskier investments with 
high rewards, fostering new products and services 
that solve local challenges. This is to help avoid the 
current challenge of funding only those products or 
services that have already been successful. 

support 
the  commercialisation  of  primary 
research, and encourage bright young minds to 
create companies at the point when they have 
few commitments. Mexico should look to seed 
an angel investment fund for new startups out of 
university based on their growth potential. This 
should  aim  to  be  sustainable  for  the  future  by 
investing on a commercial basis and retaining a 
share of the company.

c. Allow academics to hold positions in  private
companies  (Universities)  -  A  number  of 
academics  who  are  world-leading  researchers 
hold both university and private sector positions, 
for  example  Andrew  Ng  who  was  a  Stanford 
professor  and  VP  &  Chief  Scientist  of  Baidu. 
Mexico should support professors to hold joint 
positions in this way.

3.  Create a good environment for commercial 
research and applied AI in the private sector  
 

Businesses  need  certainty  and  confidence  to  be 
able  to  invest  in  intangible  assets  like  intellectual 
property. Changes emphasised by our interviewees 
which  would  encourages  businesses  to  choose 
Mexico for their R&D centres include:

a. Mapping (current administration, private 
sector)  - map the current use and needs of AI 
and automated decisions in the private sector.

 
b. IP reform (next administration)  - Update the
Intellectual  Property  Rights 
for 
emerging  technologies,  for  example,  enabling 

framework 

34

education: taking 
the wide view 

b. The national AI centre - this should maintain a 
list of recommended vocational courses which 
can be taken and will promote their uptake to 
the public (next administration).

“Focus on education at all levels”
Miguel Gonzalez Mendoza: President of the Mexican 
AI Society. 

Without the right skills in the economy, it is impossible 
to effectively harness the benefits of any innovation 
and  new  technologies.  People  need  to  be  able  to 
conceptualise  how  AI  will  work,  how  it  will  change 
assumptions  on  how  problems  can  be  solved,  and 
how  to  deploy  it.  Given  the  large  changes  in  the 
nature of work and workforce composition suggested 
by current research, there is an urgent need to create 
a  more  resilient  workforce  able  to  quickly  adapt  to 
rapid technological change.

A number of people respond to this by saying that 
AI  should  be  a  core  part  of  the  curriculum.  We  do 
not think it is that simple - technology moves on so 
quickly  that  if  you  teach  a  specific  technique  then 
there is a risk it will be out of date quickly. As a result, 
we propose complementary approaches at different 
levels:

1. Develop tools for continued education in AI 

(current and next administration)

People  who  are  in  the  workplace  will  need  to 
demonstrate that their skills are up to date. There 
are many providers of training, but quality can be 
difficult to assess. 

a. MexicoX - The National Digital Strategy can
use  the  MexicoX  Platform  to  develop  official 
programmes  and  certifications 
for  Mexican 
civil  servants 
(current  administration).  The 
next  administration  can  include  AI  training 
programmes in their national training strategy for 
public servants. 

2. Broaden AI learning beyond computer 

science and Mathematics students in public 
and private universities (next administration, 
universities)

Creating  AI  programmes  requires  core  skills  in 
computer science and mathematics. However, to 
realise the full economic potential of AI, experts from 
other disciplines also need to understand AI. Tec 
de Monterrey, for example, includes a technology 
module  in  their  non-technology  courses.  This 
prepares people for the labor market as it will be, 
not as it was. This approach should be introduced 
to other universities.

3. Teach computational approaches thinking in 

schools (new administration)  

Children are emerging into a digital world in which 
technology is changing at an ever-increasing rate. 
As a result, children should be taught concepts and 
creativity - encouraging them to create tools which 
find  new  solutions  to  problems.  We  recommend 
that computational thinking and coding is placed on 
the national curriculum, teaching children applied 
logic and creative approaches to problem solving.

4. Increase the number of Masters and PhD 

students in AI and data science (current and 
future administration)  

A  consistent  theme  from  interviewees  was  the 
shortage  of  Mexicans  with  advanced  degrees  in 
data science and machine learning.  There should 
be a sustained investment in this primary resource 
for harnessing the potential of Machine Learning in 
Mexico. 

35

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution Data
infrastructure 

AI  is  powered  by  data.  Good  quality  big  data  is 
essential  for  the  widespread  implementation  of  AI 
technologies. Without this, the transformative power 
of AI is greatly limited, and its growth stunted. If the 
data is wrong, poorly structured, or incomplete, then 
there is potential for the AI to take the wrong decisions 
or have biases.

In  order  to  create  a  data  infrastructure  that  allows 
Mexico the best possible advantage of the benefits of 
AI, we recommend:

1.  Maintain a resilient open data infrastructure 

(current and new administration)

Data is an important resource with special qualities. 
It can be expensive to collect and clean, but once it 
has been collected the onward dissemination is very 
cheap. The government should maintain and share 
core  data  services  which:  describe  the  country; 
and provide information relating to the delivery of 
public services. It should consider curating, funding 
and establish governance framework for data sets 
in  priority  sectors  to  support  as  part  of  the  pre-
competitive stage.

2. Create Mexican training data to inform AI 

applications (next administration)

Data is not neutral. It can carry with it conscious 
and unconscious biases. One of the unconscious 
biases  occurs  when  an  AI  system  is  taught  how 
to  take  decisions  from  a  data  set  which  is  not 
representative. Data sets to train AIs can be very 
expensive to create as, for example, they require 
people  to  mark  up  tens  of  thousands  of  images 
or  data  items  correctly.  As  Kate  Crawford  has 
highlighted,  the  majority  of  these  data  sets  are 
created in Silicon Valley and reflect its norms and 
values.44  The  National  AI  Centre  should  produce 
training data sets for Mexico.

3. Protect personal privacy (next administration, 

INAI) 

AI is hugely powerful and data hungry. This leads 
to organisations taking a ‘collect it first, work out 
how  to  use  it  later’  approach  to  data.  While  this 
is a sensible approach, it is important that it is not 
at the expense of personal privacy. The Mexican 
Institute  of  Access  to  Information  and  Personal 
Data Protection (INAI) should review, update and/
or create new regulatory frameworks to keep pace 
with innovation and striking the right balance.

36

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution 2. Create a Mexican AI Ethics Council (current 

and next administration)

There is a lot of debate about the ‘ethics of AI’ and 
concern over whether we are building tools which 
make  everything  easier  -  including  making  some 
harmful  things  more  effective.  Building  on  global 
work by organisations like the Institute of Electrical 
and  Electronics  Engineers, 
the  Government, 
academia,  industry  and  academia  should  enable 
the  creation  of  a  Mexican  AI  Ethics  Council 
composed  of  leading  ethicists,  business  leaders, 
and the Office for AI to:

a. Set guidelines  and limits which reflect Mexican

values; 

b. Award a quality mark for AI companies who 

abide by the standards. 

Ethics and 
regulation 

Artificial intelligence and big data are new topics, and 
the  businesses  that  are  emerging  have  unfamiliar 
structures. They are capital intensive but employ few 
people.  Instagram,  for  example,  has  more  than  a 
million users per employee. Facebook has 2.2 billion 
active users. If it were a country, it would be the largest 
country in the world. This is leading to a shift in power 
as  large  established  companies  are  transformed  or 
displaced,  and  digital  companies  accumulate  large 
user bases across national borders.

Government needs to act to make sure that existing 
systems  and  controls  are  effective  for  the  future. 
We  recommend  that  the  Government  consider  the 
following:

1. Bring data assets inside the scope of 

competition law (COFECE)

Data  is  a  competitive  asset  -  without  access  to 
data  then  it  is  not  possible  to  build  AI  or  other 
digital  services.  As  data  is  a  non-rival  good  and 
is  difficult  to  value  accurately,  it  falls  outside  the 
scope  of  anti-competitive  legislation.  The  anti-
competition law should be reviewed to ensure that 
the accumulation of data assets to the exclusion of 
other companies is within scope. 

37

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution CONCLUSION

The  rise  of  artificial  intelligence  technologies  brings 
with it substantial economic and social opportunities 
for Mexico including in the areas of poverty reduction 
and gender equality. Its young and creative population, 
its  connections  with  economies  to  its  north  and  its 
south, and the talent and energy in Mexico’s existing 
AI community are all important strengths. So too are 
existing investments in digitisation, e-government and 
data infrastructure, both at the national and regional 
levels. 

An AI strategy that works for Mexico should build on 
these  strengths  and  on  the  ambitions  we  heard  in 
interviews across the country. This means a key role 
for government: to set a strategic direction, to invest in 
Mexican data and research to help build tomorrow’s AI 

technologies, and to support the learning that will help 
citizens adapt to technological change. Civil society 
will also be critical, both in building momentum and in 
consolidating the efforts of AI experts across sectors 
in Mexico. 

AI technologies will lead to big changes in the way 
Mexicans live and work. A strong ethical focus to help 
guide  the  actions  of  government,  companies  and 
citizens using AI tools will be very important to help 
guide these changes. The decisions we make about 
artificial  intelligence  research  and  applications  will 
influence how we interact with technology for many 
years to come. Ensuring that these technologies are 
developed in safe, inclusive and ethical ways will help 
shape a better future for all Mexicans.

TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution  Appendix 2: Innovation in Mexico’s Regions
Jalisco,  CDMX,  and  Nuevo  Leon  are  leading  the 
country’s science and technology scene. AI has not 
been addressed in these states’ innovation agendas 
nor  in  their  development  plans.  However,  they  are 
building strong digital foundations that will allow for 
AI  experimentation  and  the  potential  scaling-up  of 
current AI pilots outside of government’s scope. 

For each state, we examined the following: existing 
technology  and  innovation  policies,  key  institutions,

holds, and the 2015 national Electronic Government 
Index,47 which measures the percentage of population 
18 years of age or older that had interacted with their 
State’s government electronically.

With a population of approximately nine million,48 Mexico City is the capital of the country, its newest State, and 
strongest economy, contributing alone 16.82% of national GDP.49 

Key sectors
Financial  and  insurance  services,  real  estate  and  rental  services  of  movable  and  intangible  assets,  business 
support services, and waste management and remediation services.50

Strategic areas of technology focus 
Automotive industry, home appliances, and electronics.51

Key institutions  
•  CDMX (Oficialía Mayor) is responsible for digitizing government services, developing open data policies and 
driving the city’s digital transformation. Both the General Coordination for Administrative Modernization (CGMA 
for its acronym in Spanish, and the General Direction for ICT Governance (DGGTIC) are two departments 
within the Oficialia Mayor leading all digitization efforts.

•  CDMX Secretariat of Science, Technology and Innovation (SECITI) is responsible for establishing policies 
related to the study and development of science, technology and innovation. The Secretariat also promotes, 
develops and coordinates the resultant activities to generate greater economic growth and improve citizens’ 
quality of life. SECITI seeks: 1) to build public policies based on technological solutions to the problems of the 
city; and 2) to encourage the application and development of ICT, and use them to manage the resources 
and services provided by the state in matters such as communications, education and digital government.

 Appendix 3: Methodology

Existing technology and innovation policies     

In order to calculate the proportion of jobs that might 
be  affected  by  automation,  we  used  OECD  data 
describing the number of jobs in each sector and sub-
sector in Mexico in 2016.76 We then followed O*Net’s 
analysis of how each sub-sector breaks down into its 
constituent occupations in the USA, where this data 
also offers an account of the tasks required to perform 
each occupation successfully.77 (We therefore assume 
that the distribution of occupations within sub-sectors 
is the same as in the USA, which is a weakness in 
this model. Additionally, our analysis of the proportion 
of automatable Mexican jobs is based on 2016 jobs 

data, and is not adjusted for future projections of job 
growth in Mexico.)

We assessed how likely it was that each task within 
each  occupation  would  be  automated  over  the 
short-,  medium-  and  long-term,  according  to  our 
understanding  of  the  likely  development  of  artificial 
intelligence over the next 15 years. This provided us 
with an analysis of the overall risk of automation for 
each  sub-sector  in  Mexico.  We  manually  adjusted 
any  highly  counter-intuitive  results.  The  final  short-, 
medium-and 
long-term  automation  figures  are 
cumulative over time.   

Gender figures are binary and based on OECD data 
from 2016.
