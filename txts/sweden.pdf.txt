National approach to  
artificial intelligence

Sweden aims to be the world le-
ader in harnessing the opportuni-
ties offered by digital transforma-
tion. By international standards, 
Sweden is in the vanguard. Many 
countries have high ambitions 
for their digital development and 
Sweden must work hard to ad-
vance and strengthen its efforts. 
If Sweden succeeds, there will 
be considerable scope to develop 
Swedish competitiveness and wel-
fare. One rapidly evolving field 
of digital technology is artifici-
al intelligence (AI).1 AI is a broad 
field that encompasses many tech-
nologies, not least machine lear-
ning and deep learning. What 
distinguishes AI from other auto-
mation methods is the ability of 
AI technology to learn and beco-
me smarter over time. 

Against this background, the Go-
vernment has identified the need 
to develop a national approach 
to AI in Sweden. The purpose of 
this document is to identify an 
overall direction for AI-related 
work in Sweden and lay the foun-
dation for future priorities. 

AI has the potential to contribu-
te significant benefits in a variety 
of areas through increased econo-
mic growth, and solutions to en-
vironmental and social challeng-
es. According to some studies, the 
use of AI has great potential to 
increase economic growth.2 Ex-
amples of the contributions that 
AI can make are already evident: 
AI can help to better identify di-
seases, lower energy consumption, 
reduce traffic accidents, create 

 1There is no one single, clear-cut or generally accepted definition of artificial intelligence, but many definitions. In 

general, however, AI refers to intelligence demonstrated by machines. Vinnova (Sweden’s innovation agency) (2018)

new services, streamline industrial 
production, develop new pharma-
ceutical products and shorten pro-
cessing times. 

Although AI is rapidly evolving, 
this does not mean that the be-
nefits of AI will automatically 
be realised in Sweden. For AI to 
best contribute to strengthened 
Swedish competitiveness and en-
hanced welfare, Sweden must cre-
ate the enabling conditions.

It is important that Sweden can 
manage the challenges associated 
with AI. AI will affect how people 
work, when some tasks can be au-
tomated and new tasks emerge. 
There may be unintended or unfo-
reseen consequences of using AI 
as a result of biased or manipula-
ted data, lack of transparency, mi-
suse or hostile use. This may lead 
to discrimination, loss of trust, fi-
nancial damage and consequences 
for the functioning of democracy. 
For these reasons, it is important 
for Sweden to work actively on the 
issues that AI is already raising.

The countries that succeed in har-
nessing and realising the benefits 
of AI while managing the risks in 
a responsible manner will have a 
great competitive advantage inter-
nationally. Furthermore, AI has 
considerable potential to contri-
bute to a more effective and re-
levant public sector. This is why 
the Government’s goal is to make 
Sweden a leader in harnessing 
the opportunities that the use of 
AI can offer, with the aim of st-
rengthening Sweden’s welfare and 
competitiveness. 

The goal is closely linked to the 
digital transformation goal adop-
ted by the Riksdag and comple-
ments the Government’s Digital 
Strategy. 

Key conditions for realising  
the potential of AI
For Swedish society to realise the 
potential of AI, a number of con-
ditions play a particularly impor-
tant role. These conditions are 
summarised in Figure 1.

Sweden needs to develop its long-
term supply of knowledge and ex-
pertise in the field of AI if it wants 
to reap the benefits of AI. The 
need for relevant knowledge of AI 
must be met through education 
and training, continuing educa-
tion and research. Innovation and 
use initiatives are also needed to 
promote early application projects. 
Sweden also needs to ensure access 
to data and infrastructure, such as 
computational capacity, in addition 
to appropriate national, European 
and international frameworks. 

” The Government’s goal 
is to make Sweden a  
leader in harnessing the 
opportunities that the 
use of AI can offer, with 
the aim of strengthening 
Sweden’s welfare and 
competitiveness.”

The active promotion of AI app-
lications in public sector activi-
ties can play a significant role in 
how the public sector succeeds in 
responding to major social chal-
lenges of the future. Public stake-
holders should therefore actively 
support AI applications by ma-
king relevant data available and 
creating national digital infra-
structure, taking security and in-
tegrity issues into account. 

A cross-cutting theme should be 
sustainable AI, meaning that AI 
applications should be ethical, 
safe, secure, reliable and trans-
parent. This applies in particu-
lar to critical systems and systems 
that may affect the physical world,

such as self-driving vehicles or  
AI applications in health care. In 
AI applications, ethical, safety  
and security considerations can-
not be an afterthought; they must 
be an integral part of the early  
design stage.  

If Sweden can strengthen these 
conditions, it will be well placed 
to offer an internationally att-
ractive working environment for 
business, researchers and others 
interested in AI research, develop-
ment and use. 

The purpose of this national app-
roach is to identify some of the 
most important conditions for 
societal stakeholders to mana-
ge together in relation to AI. For 
Sweden to reap the benefits of AI, 
all sectors of society must be in-
volved; this is not an issue that the 
state, municipalities, county coun-
cils, academia or private compa-
nies can deal with on their own.

Education and training

The Government’s assessment is that

• 

• 

• 

Swedish higher education institutions need to provide a sufficient 
number of people with AI education and training, particularly in 
continuing and further education for professionals with a university 
degree or equivalent. 

Sweden needs a strong AI component in non-technical programmes 
to create the conditions for broad and responsible application of the 
technology. 

Sweden needs a strong link between research, higher education and 
innovation in the field of AI.

It is essential that a sufficient 
number of people have the skills 
required to develop and use AI 
technology if the whole of Sweden 
is to benefit from AI. AI know-
ledge and expertise must be av-
ailable throughout society – in 
large and small businesses, in mu-
nicipalities, county councils and 
government agencies. Using the 
same broad approach, Sweden 
also needs to enhance cyber se-
curity expertise. Today, there is a 
shortage of people with AI exper-
tise both in Sweden and around 
the world, resulting in stiff inter-
national competition for qualified 
people. As the use of AI increa-
ses, the shortage of expertise is 
likely to become more and more 
tangible. If broader use of AI is 
to become a reality, it is essential 
that Sweden educates and trains a 
sufficient number of people in the 
field. 

Sweden’s higher education institu-
tions are already developing their 
educational offer to meet the di-
gital challenge. Engineering pro-

grammes in particular are highly 
relevant in this initial phase of 
work. However, the many uses of 
AI justify a wider interdisciplina-
ry perspective on the program-
mes that are included. Interdis-
ciplinary knowledge is crucial in 
ensuring ethical, safe, secure and 
sustainable use of AI. Relevant AI 
knowledge is not only essential 
for technical experts but also for 
leaders, managers and other pro-
fessionals who interact with tech-
nology.

The rapid development of AI cre-
ates an increased need for lifelong 
learning. Opportunities for rele-
vant continuing and further edu-
cation for practising professionals 
are therefore necessary. According 
to Vinnova’s (Sweden’s innovation 
agency) assessments, there is a par-
ticularly large need, in the short 
term, for continuing and further 
AI education for people with a 
university degree. Closer colla-
boration between several societal 
actors is needed to address this.

Increasingly rapid technological 
and societal development will re-
quire a very strong relationship 
between research, higher educa-
tion and innovation in AI.  

Research

The Government’s assessment is that

• 

• 

• 

• 

Sweden needs both strong basic research and strong applied resear-
ch in AI to ensure knowledge and skills supply in the field.

Sweden needs strong relations with leading international AI research 
environments.

Sweden needs strong collaboration between business, the public 
sector and research in AI.

Sweden needs to exploit the synergies between civil research and 
defence research from a total defence perspective.

Strong research in AI is essential 
for Sweden to realise the oppor-
tunities the technology creates. 
Strong basic research creates new 
knowledge that applied research 
can build on to solve specific pro-
blems, for example. It is impor-
tant that both basic research and 
applied research, closely linked to-
gether, are conducted in Sweden 
to strengthen Swedish skills supp-
ly and competitiveness.

AI and machine learning research 
is technologically advanced and 
specialised, and increasingly in-
volves multiple disciplines. Inter-
nationally, major investments are 
being made in AI research,  
especially in the United States and 
China. In Sweden, a large share 
of the central government rese-
arch appropriations goes to basic 
research that is related in vary-
ing degrees to AI, such as compu-
ter science and mathematics, and 
primarily conducted at the tech-
nology-focused higher education 
institutions. In November 2017, 
the Knut and Alice Wallenberg 

Foundation (KAW) also announ-
ced that it would donate SEK 1 
billion to AI research. This repre-
sents a significant contribution to 
Swedish research in this field.

al opportunities for coordination 
between civil research and defen-
ce research, including cybersecu-
rity and autonomous systems, that 
should be seized.

Most of the world’s leading AI 
research is conducted beyond 
Sweden’s borders. If Sweden is 
to be at the forefront of AI rese-
arch, it is important to maintain 
and develop cooperation with 
research environments in other 
countries. The EU plays a major 
role in Swedish research, not least 
through the EU Framework Pro-
gramme for Research and Inno-
vation. 

Both the public and private se-
ctors are very interested in har-
nessing and commercialising new 
research findings on AI. Inno-
vative AI research will be able to 
contribute to exports, enhanced 
public services and new jobs. At 
the same time, it is important that 
AI systems are carefully designed 
to prevent them from doing harm. 
It is therefore important that com-
panies and public institutions 
collaborate with relevant acade-
mic environments, for example 
through joint projects or staff ex-
changes. It is also important to 
promote the development of AI 
by linking it to the skills availa-
ble in Sweden around large-scale 
computations with high-perfor-
mance computing.

AI is also a growing field in de-
fence research. There are potenti-

Innovation and use

The Government’s assessment is that

• 

• 

• 

Sweden needs pilot projects, testbeds and environments for deve-
lopment of AI applications in the public and private sectors, that can 
contribute to the use of AI evolving in a safe, secure and responsible 
manner.  

Sweden needs to continue to develop efforts to prevent and manage 
the risks associated with AI. 

Sweden needs to develop partnerships and collaborations on the use 
of AI applications with other countries, especially within the EU.

The opportunities that AI offers 
only create value when the techno-
logy is widely used in the private 
and public sectors. Companies in 
all industries could develop their 
competitiveness with the help of 
AI. Most companies will also need 
to decide on their approach to AI 
as its impact on businesses and in-
dustries will be profound. There is 
great potential in the public sector 
to develop activities and public ser-
vices in the citizens’ interest with 
the help of AI. It is therefore in 
Sweden’s interest to stimulate inno-
vative applications and use of AI in 
society in various ways. 

Pilot projects, testbeds and other 
specialised testing environments 
are among the tools that may be 
important in accelerating the in-
troduction of new AI technology 
in an ethical, safe, secure and sus-
tainable manner. Through pro-
jects to develop new AI applica-
tions, research findings can be put 
to practical use, adapted to real 
conditions, evaluated and made 
more widely available. 

AI also entails risks. These may in-
clude new types of intelligent cy-
ber-attacks or manipulated data that 
can have serious consequences. AI 
may also lower the thresholds for 
attacks against democratic practices 
such as through disinformation. 

The risks associated with AI are 
not only technical but also ethi-
cal, particularly with regard to 
applications in the public sector. 
The use of AI algorithms must be 
transparent and comprehensible. 
The use of AI requires account 
to be taken of moral and legal iss-
ues, and presents challenges rela-
ted to rule of law procedures and 
the automation of agency deci-
sions. A widely discussed ethical 
issue is how an autonomous ve-
hicle should reason and act if, in 
an emergency, it is forced to choo-
se between two outcomes, both of 
which mean that people might be 
injured. Sweden can take the lead 
in ethical, safe, secure and sustai-
nable use of AI by actively wor-
king on this issue nationally and 
promoting it internationally. 

The potential benefits of AI can 
be enormous in both the pri-
vate and public sector, even if it is 
difficult to quantify them today. 
Public sector innovation projects 
where AI tools are adapted and 
used, and where skills enhance-
ment takes place, can have a signi-
ficant impact on the effectiveness 
and quality of activities. 

Sweden’s public sector has an al-
most unique volume of high qu-
ality data, which is often a prere-
quisite for AI applications and if 
properly managed can contribute 
to creating considerable benefits. 
Examples of AI applications are 
already emerging from governme-
nt agencies, county councils and 
municipalities. There can therefore 
be added value in harnessing these 
new opportunities for developing 
and providing public services in 
different parts of the public sector.

Sweden is a small country with 
a small domestic market. At the 
same time, many countries are in-
vesting heavily in AI. Sweden will

therefore need to develop part-
nerships with prominent players 
in other countries. In this context, 
the EU is an important arena. 
However, international coopera-
tion must consider national secu-
rity interests and the division of 
competences between the EU and 
its Member States.

Framework and infrastructure

The Government’s assessment is that

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Sweden needs to develop rules, standards, norms and ethical  
principles to guide ethical and sustainable AI and the use of AI. 

Sweden needs to push for Swedish and international standards and 
regulations that promote the use of AI and prevent risks. 

Sweden needs to continuously review the need for digital  
infrastructure to harness the opportunities that AI can provide.

Sweden needs to continue the work on making data available to  
serve as infrastructure for AI use in areas where it adds value. 

Sweden needs to continue to play an active role in the EU’s efforts 
to promote digitisation and reap the benefits that the use of AI can 
bring. 

In light of the societal transforma-
tion that AI entails, it is important 
to work for a coherent and strate-
gic AI policy that aims to create 
a safe, secure and favourable cli-
mate for digitisation and harnes-
sing the opportunities of AI. The 
development and use of AI need 
to be guided by norms and ethi-
cal principles aimed at harnessing 
the benefits while minimising the 
risks to both society and individu-
als. This is not only a matter for 
researchers and engineers but for 
a wide range of professions. 

Access to data is the lifeblood of 
AI and a crucial part of the in-
frastructure. As societies become 
increasingly digital, a growing vo-
lume of data is available in digital 
form. This includes manually and 
automatically collected data, such 
as data from sensors. Extensive 
efforts are often required to pro-

duce usable data. Risks may arise 
in the form of incorrect or other-
wise undesirable outcomes if data 
is of low quality, for example as a 
result of registration errors, sys-
tematic (intentional and uninten-
tional) errors in data collection, 
source selection or data label-
ling. Appropriate frameworks of 
principles, norms, standards and 
rules are therefore important pre-
requisites if Sweden is to realise 
the benefits of AI in society. Such 
frameworks must balance funda-
mental needs for privacy, ethics, 
trust and social protection with 
access to the data needed to reali-
se the potential of AI. 

Regulatory frameworks at Euro-
pean and international level, for 
example cross-border data trans-
fer rules, are also important. The 
EU’s General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR),3 which app-

3Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of  

natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repea-

ling Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).

10       National approach to artificial intelligence

lies from 25 May 2018, provides 
strong privacy protection in per-
sonal data processing and for this 
reason is an important part of the 
AI framework. How different sta-
keholders are able to implement 
the GDPR in their respective acti-
vities will play a major role in how 
well Sweden is able to manage 
both the benefits and risks of AI.

In such a rapidly evolving field 
of technology as AI, guidelines 
and standards will be needed at 
an early stage to guide both pri-
vate and public stakeholders. AI 
standards have the potential to 
promote technical, semantic, legal 
and other forms of interoperabili-
ty both within and between com-
panies and public institutions, and 
to contribute to greater clarity for 
users and consumers. 

Different types of infrastructure 
are also important for the deve-
lopment and use of AI. For ex-
ample, certain parts of AI deve-
lopment require access to large 
volumes of data and extensive 

computational capacity. Sweden’s 
supercomputer resources at 
Swedish higher education institu-
tions that are collected under the 
Swedish National Infrastructure 
for Computing (SNIC) are an im-
portant resource in this context. 

Many of the regulatory fra-
meworks and guidelines that 
Sweden must take into account 
come from the EU. If Sweden is 
to be able to benefit from initiati-
ves taken within EU frameworks, 
it is important that structures and 
expertise are in place. Sweden the-
refore needs to take part in the Eu-
ropean AI debate and play an ac-
tive role in EU efforts to reap the 
benefits that use of AI can bring.
