A Next Generation Artificial  
Intelligence Development Plan 

 
The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) will profoundly change human society 
and life and change the world. To seize the major strategic opportunity for the development 
of AI, to build China’s first-mover advantage in the development of AI, to accelerate the 
construction of an innovative nation and global power in science and technology, in 
accordance with the requirements of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council, this 
plan has been formulated. 

I.  The Strategic Situation 
 
The development of AI has entered a new stage. After sixty years of evolution, especially in 
mobile Internet, big data, supercomputing, sensor networks, brain science, and other new 
theories and new technologies, under the joint impetus of powerful demands of economic 
and social development, AI’s development has accelerated, displaying deep learning, 
cross-domain integration, man-machine collaboration, the opening of swarm intelligence, 
autonomous control, and other new characteristics. Big data-driven cognitive learning, 
cross-media collaborative processing, and man-machine collaboration–strengthened 
intelligence, swarm integrated intelligence, and autonomous intelligent systems have 
become the focus of the development of AI. The results of brain science research inspired 
human-like intelligence that awaits action; the trends involving the chips, hardware, and 
platform have become apparent; the development of AI has entered into a new stage. At 
present, the development a new generation of AI and related disciplines, theoretical 
modeling, technological innovation, hardware and software upgrades, etc., all advance, 
provoking chain-style breakthroughs, promoting the acceleration of the elevation of 
economic and social domains from digitization and networkization to intelligentization.  
 
AI has become a new focus of international competition. AI is a strategic technology that 
will lead in the future; the world’s major developed countries are taking the development of 
AI as a major strategy to enhance national competitiveness and protect national security; 
intensifying the introduction of plans and strategies for this core technology, top talent, 
standards and regulations, etc.; and trying to seize the initiative in the new round of 
international science and technology competition. At present, China’s situation in national 
security and international competition is more complex, and [China] must, looking at the 
world, take the development of AI to the national strategic level with systemic layout, take 
the initiative in planning, firmly seize the strategic initiative in the new stage of 
international competition in AI development, to create new competitive advantage, 
opening up the development of new space, and effectively protecting national security. 
 
AI has become a new engine of economic development. AI has become the core driving 
force for a new round of industrial transformation, [which] will advance the release of the 

2 

huge energy stored from the previous scientific and technological revolution and industrial 
transformation, and create a new powerful engine, reconstructing production, distribution, 
exchange, consumption, etc., links in economic activities; with new demands taking shape 
from the macro to the micro within each domain of intelligentization; with the birth of new 
technologies, new products, new industries, new formats, new models; triggering 
significant changes in economic structure, profound changes in human modes of 
production, lifestyle, and thinking; and a whole leap of achieving social productivity. 
China’s economic development enters a new normal, deepening the supply side of 
structural reform task is very arduous, [and China] must accelerate the rapid application of 
AI, cultivating and expanding AI industries to inject new kinetic energy into China’s 
economic development. 
 
AI brings new opportunities for social construction. China is currently in the decisive stage 
of comprehensively constructing a moderately prosperous society. The challenges of 
population aging, environmental constraints, etc., remain serious. The widespread use of AI 
in education, medical care, pensions, environmental protection, urban operations, judicial 
services, and other fields will greatly improve the level of precision in public services, 
comprehensively enhancing the people’s quality of life. AI technologies can accurately 
sense, forecast, and provide early warning of major situations for infrastructure facilities 
and social security operations; grasp group cognition and psychological changes in a 
timely manner; and take the initiative in decision-making and reactions—which will 
significantly elevate the capability and level of social governance, playing an irreplaceable 
role in effectively maintaining social stability. 
 
The uncertainties in the development of AI create new challenges. AI is a disruptive 
technology with widespread influence that may cause: transformation of employment 
structures; impact on legal and social theories; violations of personal privacy; challenges in 
international relations and norms; and other problems. It will have far-reaching effects on 
the management of government, economic security, and social stability, as well as global 
governance. While vigorously developing AI, we must attach great importance to the 
potential safety risks and challenges, strengthen the forward-looking prevention and 
guidance on restraint, minimize risk, and ensure the safe, reliable, and controllable 
development of AI. 
 
China possesses a favorable foundation for the development of AI. The nation has: 
deployed the National Key Research and Development Plan’s key special projects, such as 
intelligent manufacturing; issued and implemented the “Internet +” and AI Three-Year 
Activities and Implementation Program, releasing a series of measures from science and 
technology research and development; and promoted applications and industrial 
development, and other aspects. As a result of many years of continuous accumulation, 
China has achieved important progress in the field of AI, with the number of international 
scientific and technology papers published and the number of inventions patented ranked 
second in the world, while achieving important breakthroughs in certain domains of core 
crucial technologies. Leading the world in voice recognition and visual recognition 
technologies; initially possessing the capability for leapfrog development in adaptive 
autonomous learning, intuitive sensing, comprehensive reasoning, hybrid intelligence, and 
swarm intelligence, etc.; with Chinese information processing, intelligent monitoring, 
biometric identification, industrial robots, service robots, and unmanned driving gradually 
entering practical application; AI innovation and entrepreneurship have become 
increasingly active, and a number of leading enterprises have accelerated their growth, 

3 

receiving widespread concern and recognition internationally. Accelerate the accumulation 
of technological capabilities and massive data resources, the organization integration of 
both the huge demand for applications and an open market environment, which together 
constitute China’s unique advantage in AI development. 
 
At the same time, we must also clearly see that there is still a gap between China’s overall 
level of development of AI relative to that of developed countries—lacking major original 
results in the basic theory, core algorithms, key equipment, high-end chips, major products 
and systems, foundational materials, components, software and interfaces, etc. Scientific 
research institutions and enterprises do not yet possess international influence upon 
ecological cycles and supply chain, lacking a systematic research and development layout; 
cutting-edge talent for AI is far from meeting demand. Adapting to the development of AI 
requires the urgent improvement of basic infrastructure, policies and regulations, and 
standards systems. 
 
Facing a new situation and new demands, we must take the initiative to pursue and adapt 
to change, firmly seize the major historic opportunity for the development of AI, stick 
closely to development, study and evaluate the general trends, take the initiative to plan, 
grasp the direction, seize the opportunity, lead the world in new trends in the development 
of AI, serve economic and social development, and support national security, promoting 
the overall elevation of the nation’s competitiveness and leapfrog development.

up research, adhere to a problem-oriented, accurate grasping of technology and industry 
trends. Enhance the awareness of risk, pay attention to risk assessment and prevention 
and control, and strengthen prospective prevention and restraint guidance. In the near 
term focus on the impact on employment, with a long-term focus on the impact on social 
ethics, to ensure that the development of AI falls with the sphere of secure and 
controllable. Establish and improve an open and transparent AI supervision system, the 
implementation of design accountability, and application of the supervision of a two-tiered 
regulatory structure, to achieve management of the whole process of AI algorithm design, 
product development and results application. Promote AI industry and enterprise self-
discipline, and earnestly strengthen management, increase disciplinary efforts aimed at 
the abuse of data, violations of personal privacy, and actions contrary to moral ethics. 
Strengthen AI cybersecurity technology research and development, strengthen AI products 
and systems cybersecurity protection. Develop dynamic AI research and development 
evaluation mechanisms, focus on AI design, product and system complexity, risk, 
uncertainty, interpretability, potential economic impact, and other issues. Develop a 
systematic testing methods and indicators system. Construct a cross-domain AI test 
platform to promote AI security certification, and assessment of AI products and systems 
key performance. 

(5) Vigorously strengthen the training of an AI labor force 
 
Accelerate the study of the employment structure brought on by AI, changes in 
employment methods, and the skills demand of new occupations and jobs, establish a 
lifelong learning and employment training system to meet the needs of the intelligent 
economy and intelligent society, and support institutions of higher learning, vocational 
schools and socialization training Institutions to carry out AI skills training.  Substantially 
increase the professional skills of workers to meet the development requirements of 
China's AI to bring high-quality jobs. Encourage enterprises and organizations to provide AI 
skills training for employees. Strengthen the re-employment training and guidance of

VI.  Organization and Implementation 
 
The development plan for a new generation of AI is a far-sighted scheme affecting the 
overall picture and the long term. We must strengthen organizational leadership, complete 
mechanisms, take aim at objectives, keep tasks closely in view, realistically grasp 
implementation with a spirit of hammering nails, and carry out the blueprint to the end. 

(1) Organizational leadership 
 
According to the unified deployment of the Party Center and the State Council, the National 
Science and Technology Structural Reform and Innovation System Construction Leading 
Small Group will take the lead in comprehensive planning and coordination, it will 
deliberate major tasks, major policies, major questions, and major work arrangements. 
Promote AI-related legal and regulatory construction. Guide, coordinate and supervise 
relevant departments in carrying out the deployment and implementation of tasks from the 
plan. With the support of the interministerial joint conferences for national science and 
technology planning (earmarks, funding, etc.) management, the Ministry of Science and 
Technology will, together with relevant departments, be responsible for moving forward the 
implementation of major science and technology programmes for a new generation of AI, 
and strengthen linkages and coordination with other programmatic tasks. Establish an AI 
Plan Implementation Office. This office will be part of the Ministry of Science and 
Technology and will be concretely responsible for moving the implementation of the plan 
forward. Establish an AI Strategy Advisory Committee, to research major far-sighted and 
strategic questions concerning AI and to provide advice and assessment concerning major
